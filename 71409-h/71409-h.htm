 ><small>METHOD OF HALTERING A COLT.</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> first step towards the breaking-in of a
horse is placing a halter upon his head.</p>

<p>There are many methods of doing this in
vogue, most of which are by brute force; for
instance, a farmer has a colt he wishes to
halter, so he gets his men together, and drives
the colt into a yard or stable; a man then
hangs on to the timid animal by one of his ears
and his nose, another man seizes his tail, whilst
three or four more men push against either
side of the poor frightened beast; then ensues
a struggle: the colt, frightened out of his senses
and not knowing what is required of him, fights
the half-dozen men clinging to him; he rears,
kicks, bites, and strikes with his fore feet. The
<a id="png.p004" href="#png.p004"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>men on seeing this, and the farmer standing
near, say he is a savage brute, and must be
reduced by savage means. The colt is then
beaten with a broom or pitchfork-handle, his
tail is twisted, and every means of inflicting
excruciating pain is resorted to, which instead
of subduing the animal has the reverse effect;
the colt, being driven to madness, struggles and
fights until he vanquishes his foes. There is
then a consultation between the farmer and his
men, and at last this ferocious beast is haltered
by stratagem, but throughout all his life he is
either vicious or extremely nervous and shy,
for he will never forget his first introduction to
mankind, and the rough usage he then underwent.</p>

<p>I well remember a scene enacted during the
above process, and think I cannot do better
than recount it here.</p>

<p>The colt to be haltered was driven into an
empty stable, and got into one of the stalls;
the men then all pressed forward to keep him
there, and the above method of haltering was
<a id="png.p005" href="#png.p005"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>gone through, but the colt being a game one,
kicked a hole through the partition, and
knocked some of the men down. After the
men had recovered themselves they began
again, but with this difference, that two of them
got the colt’s tail through the hole in the partition,
and hung on to it with might and main,
they being in security on the opposite side of
the partition to that on which the colt was.
Thinking it was not my business to interfere
with the owner’s orders, I stood by and
watched this process for an hour and a half,
till at last the men being exhausted, and the
colt as game as ever, the owner asked my
opinion as to how the animal could be haltered,
on which I told him that if he would withdraw
his men I would halter him myself, which I
accordingly did in about a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>To proceed with the subject of this chapter:
the colt or filly (throughout this treatise I shall
assume that every animal to be broken-in is a
colt, for if I spoke of colts and fillies I should
only confuse myself as well as my readers) to
<a id="png.p006" href="#png.p006"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be haltered should be driven into a yard, stable,
or loose box as quietly as possible—the best way
being to lead an old horse, and endeavour to
entice the young one to follow, having one or two
men to walk quietly behind to keep him up, for
he might otherwise lag behind and then gallop
off by himself in an opposite direction. If the
men follow up quietly, and at a certain distance
(for they must not be too close, or the animal
will take fright and gallop away) the colt will,
as a rule, follow his leader. The most important
point is perfect quietness on the part of the
men engaged in this business; they should,
however, speak in low soothing tones to the
colt, and do anything they may happen to
think of to allay the fears of the young animal.
The men should keep their arms still; in fact,
the best thing they can do is to put their hands
in their trouser pockets, <em>and keep them there</em>.
They must on no account yell and shout, but do
all they can to prevent the colt thinking they
are following him; in short, they should dissemble
as far as possible, and try to imagine
<a id="png.p007" href="#png.p007"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>themselves out for a quiet stroll, and that the
movements of the colt before them have nothing
in the world to do with them. By this
means a colt can be driven to the place selected
to halter him in with little or no trouble; but
let there be any fuss or unusual noise, and the
animal will then, through his instinct, guess
that something is going to happen to him, and
will show you a clean pair of heels.</p>

<p>I will now suppose the colt has been driven
into a stable with the old horse, and will also
go so far as to suppose that there is a loose box
in the stable. Not more than two men should
be in the stable now, one of them to hold the
old horse, and watch his opportunity of leading
him out, and the other to insinuate himself by
degrees between the colt and the old horse, and
stop the colt rushing out when he finds the
horse is leaving him. My reason for now removing
the old horse is, that whether in haltering
a colt, or during any other process of
breaking-in, you should always dispense with
anything that is calculated to draw the colt’s
<a id="png.p008" href="#png.p008"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>gaze from yourself, for <em>you require his undivided
attention</em>. A child cannot learn his
alphabet and play with the animals in his
Noah’s ark at the same time; much less, therefore,
can a colt, being unable to understand
what you say to him, learn by your voice,
manner, and caresses, what you wish of him,
when there is another horse or man near him,
whose least movement will attract his attention,
if not alarm him, being as he is in a perfectly
new position—namely, in close contact with a
man, who as yet he is unable to perceive will
hurt him or not, but his instinct points to the
former.</p>

<p>After the removal of the old horse, and the
stable door being closed, one man only should
be in the stable with the colt, who will
endeavour to get him into the loose box, the
door of which should have been previously
opened. There should be no noise or bustle
outside the stable to distract the colt. The
man in the stable must keep quiet, and allow
the colt to smell about and inspect everything,
<a id="png.p009" href="#png.p009"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>taking advantage from time to time of any of his
movements to manœuvre him into the box.
The great thing is time; take plenty of time,
do not hurry, but watch your opportunities
of improving your position. This may be
compared to a General commanding an army
in action; he stands quietly watching the battle,
and gives orders to his men to take up such
situations as from time to time he sees will lead
to the success of his army.</p>

<p>By degrees the colt gets nearer his loose
box, and out of sheer curiosity walks in to
inspect it. Now is your time; walk up quickly
but quietly and close the door. If you make
much noise and fuss about it, the colt will become
alarmed and rush out, and then, through
your own fault, you will have to go through the
whole performance again.</p>

<p>You had better now leave the colt alone
for half an hour or so, that he may become
accustomed to his new quarters, after which
you may endeavour to halter him. Select a
halter with a long ‘shank’ (I prefer one about
<a id="png.p010" href="#png.p010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>eight feet in length, if it is much longer it will
be an encumbrance), and tie a knot in it so as
to prevent the nose-band pinching the jaws
when the colt pulls at the rope on finding he is
fast. Enter the loose box and close the door,
hang the halter up out of the way of the colt,
for it is better to approach him first without it.
Avoid all unnecessary movements of the arms,
as they will frighten the colt; when you take
a step, do it slowly and quietly; if you only
take one step in a minute, it will repay you; be
deliberate, quiet, and gentle in every movement.
The colt will now be watching you,
not being able to understand what is going to
happen. Speak to him soothingly, and approach
gently and slowly. Watch him, do not stare
in his eyes with a ferocious look, as some
people do, under the impression that by so
doing they can subdue the wildest animal. I
have been told it will tame a lion or tiger,
but I know it will <em>not</em> subdue a horse, for I
have <em>tried</em> it. Do not fix your eye on any one
spot on his body, but keep moving them from
<a id="png.p011" href="#png.p011"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his eyes to his ears, from his tail to his legs, in
fact keep them running all over his body, for a
man who knows a horse will understand by
any one or combined movements of the above
parts what sort of temper the colt is in, and
also in what form he may expect an attack.
For instance, if the colt shake his tail impatiently,
and move one of his hind legs, you
may look out for a kicker; if he arch his
neck, lay his ears back, and take short snaps
with his mouth, you must take care he does
not bite you; if he paw viciously with his fore-feet,
he probably will strike you if he can. I
do not lay these rules down as facts which are
invincible, but that they generally show in
which direction the temper of the colt will be
manifested, and thus the breaker-in can avoid
being bitten, kicked, or struck if he keep his
eyes open. As a rule, however, the man
should imagine that every colt has <em>each and
every one of these tricks</em>, and thus be prepared
for any or all that may present themselves.</p>

<p>I cannot lay down any rule as to what
<a id="png.p012" href="#png.p012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>point on the body the hand should first touch;
the best place undoubtedly is the shoulder, but
you must use your own judgment after having
watched the animal as to what part of his body
is most accessible. Some colts will allow you
to touch their heads directly, whilst others—and
I think they are the most numerous—present
their tails to you. Anyhow, in whichever
part they seem most inclined to allow your first
caresses, you must make it your <em>rule</em> to, by
degrees, manipulate <em>towards the head</em>; which,
after you have <em>once</em> been permitted to handle
freely, you may consider the battle as won: for
are not the senses of seeing, hearing, smelling,
and sensation (I have no doubt that the sense
of taste has also something to do with the matter)
fully developed in the head? Thus, I
make a point of advising my readers <em>always</em> to
make an effort to handle the head, as by a more
intimate and scrutinising inspection of your
hand and body the colt is better enabled to
arrive at a fair understanding with you.</p>

<p>Now that the colt has allowed you to
<a id="png.p013" href="#png.p013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>handle him to a certain extent, and has found
you are not going to hurt him, you may leave
his side (quietly and slowly as when you approached
him) and get the halter you previously
hung up; but avoid all hurry, jerking of the
arms, &amp;c. Hold the halter in the left hand
with the ‘shank’ coiled up, the end of which
you must grasp with the right hand. Approach
the colt gently as before, speaking soothingly
to him; place your right hand on any part of
his body which is easiest got at, and work your
way gently up to the neck; spend some time
here handling him with your right hand containing
the ‘shank’ end (I am here supposing
the man to be on the near side of the animal,
where he ought always to endeavour to be).
Having reached the mane, pay the rope out
slowly between your fingers, so that it will fall
on the off side of the neck; when about eighteen
inches to a couple of feet have been worked
out through your fingers, you will see the end
of the rope hanging down under the neck on
the off side. You must now keep handling the
<a id="png.p014" href="#png.p014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>neck downwards until your hand is close to the
rope’s end, when you must catch it quietly and
tie it on the near side so as to form a noose
round the animal’s neck. You can do all this
easily with your one hand as it is all finger
work, but if you have your left hand to help
you there would in all probability be a good
deal of elbow movement which would frighten
the colt, make him move, and most likely all
your manipulation would have to be gone
through again.</p>

<p>Although as yet the halter is not on the
colt’s head, it is virtually there; for now that
you have a rope round his neck you have him
to a certain extent in your power, and the rest
is comparatively easy. The next move is to
endeavour to place the halter on his head with
your left hand, whilst you hold the rope in
your right, thus have partial control over the
animal. When the halter is near his nose he
will ‘bob’ his head, move away, and feeling
the constraint of the rope round his neck for
the first time, will struggle and endeavour to
<a id="png.p015" href="#png.p015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>drag you to the other side of the box; but he
will soon give in, and then you can easily place
the halter on his head, after which untie the
‘shank’ round his neck, and all is finished.</p>

<p>You must now handle him, pet him, talk to
him, and make much of him, but do not pull at
the halter so as to make him fight. In half-an-hour
or so you can slip a leather head-stall
over the halter, and remove the latter. Some
people may say: ‘Why do you not put the
head-stall on first instead of taking all this time
and bother to put a halter on?’ My answer is
this: the halter is easiest put on, for the throat
strap in the head-stall, unlike that of the bridle,
is a fixture, and in placing it on the head this
throat strap scrapes along the skin from the
chin to the angle of the jaw, causing the colt
uneasiness; and another drawback is, that in
buckling on the head-stall the colt takes fright,
jerks his head, and down drops the head-stall
at your feet: but if you put it on over the
halter the colt has by this time got used to seeing
and feeling your hand about his head, and
<a id="png.p016" href="#png.p016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>also you can steady his head with the halter.
Again, I think I hear the question: ‘Why do
you take so much time and trouble to tie the
halter shank round the colt’s neck when you
might throw a lasso over his head in a second?’
My answer to this is, that I do not wish to
frighten the colt, but by gentleness and kindness
to make him repose confidence in me.</p>

<p>If you can spare time, after placing the
head-stall on the colt’s head you may handle
him for a time, then place water and food
within his reach, and leave him to himself for
the rest of the day to get accustomed to his
new headdress.</p>

<p>On the following day you can handle him
quietly in the loose box and offer him choice
locks of hay or corn out of your hand to increase
his intimacy with you, and then you
may tie a rope to the head-stall and fasten him
up. He is sure to struggle when he finds himself
tied up, therefore you must not leave him;
for if you have done your work properly he
will have already recognised you as a friend
<a id="png.p017" href="#png.p017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and not a foe, and will, when he hears you
speaking to him soothingly and encouragingly,
become quieter by degrees, and will soon cease
to resist. Stay with him for half-an-hour and
pet him, then release him, take off the rope
from the head-stall, and leave him to himself.
The day following you can repeat the above,
and afterwards let him out in a yard or paddock
by himself for exercise; do not stay with
him, but let him amuse himself as he likes.</p>

<p>He has learnt his lessons very well so far,
and will be all the more fit for future instruction
if he is allowed a little recreation. There
is no greater mistake than tying up a colt for
half a day at a time; it makes him disgusted
with his lessons and also tends to make him
hate the sight of his instructor, which should
always be guarded against. The wildest colt I
ever saw when first handled, was after a fortnight’s
handling so fond of his breaker-in that
he would follow him about wherever he went
in an open field, without having any allurements
held out to him in the shape of corn &amp;c.</p>

 ><small>LONGEING THE COLT.</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> colt may now be ‘longed’ and taught to
lead.</p>

<p>Having procured a long cavasson of webbing
with a spring swivel at one end, fasten it to the
headstall, open the door of the loose box and
allow the colt to walk out, following him up
quietly and regulating your pace to his, so that
he will not feel himself in bondage until he is
outside the stable, otherwise he would, on finding
he was not free, commence to struggle, and
might possibly injure himself by running against
the stall posts or slipping upon the stone floor.
Once outside the stable endeavour to get the
colt to the place selected for longeing, which
should be as near as possible. Do not pull at
him, but try to get him there by cunningness,
that is to say, by taking advantage of his
<a id="png.p022" href="#png.p022"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>movements and manœuvring as much as possible to
make him go there of his own accord. Avoid
pulling at him until you arrive at the longing
ground, for he is sure to resist and fight, and it
is best that this should not take place before
you get to the cleared space required for his
longing, otherwise obstacles such as trees, gate-posts, &amp;c.,
will interfere very much in your
command over him and might also injure him.
If he should struggle before you have got him
into a clear space, use all your strength to hold
him, but keep as quiet as possible, or he
will become so terrified at your struggles as
to fight all the more, and it will become a
pitched battle between the colt at one end of
the cavasson and yourself at the other for
mastery. Speak to him quietly, but at the
same time keep up a firm steady pull at him,
when, as he has already become accustomed to
being tied up, he will soon give in and leave off
struggling. You must now slacken the cavasson
a little, and decrease the distance between you
by taking a few steps quietly towards him, then
<a id="png.p023" href="#png.p023"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>stand still and talk to him, when he will soon
recover himself and walk off again, of course in
the direction required, for you will have placed
him between you and the longeing ground, thus
he will walk away <em>from</em> you to it. Having
arrived at last at the spot selected, take the
initiative by planting your feet firmly and<!-- TN: original reads "and and" -->
taking a pull at the colt, thus giving him
his first real lesson in submission. He of course
will be astonished at your temerity and struggle,
but will soon give in, when you must try to
induce him quietly to walk, trot, or canter as
he likes in a circle round you, the length of the
cavasson being the radius of the circle. It is as
well to have a whip with you, but do not use it
or even crack it until every other means have
been tried to induce the colt to do as you wish.
As a rule he will give no trouble, but will run
round you at the length of his halter, pulling
more or less strongly upon the cavasson. Keep
him at it for a time, and then gradually shorten
the cavasson and stop him, pat him, speak
kindly to him, and make much of him, giving
<a id="png.p024" href="#png.p024"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>him a handful of corn or anything he may be
accustomed to eat. After having rested him
you may start him again but in the <em>opposite</em>
direction, so as not to tire his legs or make him
disgusted with his work. He will soon leave
off pulling against you, and when he becomes a
little tired he will get used to your word of
command and will be glad to stop when told to
do so, when you should always approach and
make much of him. It is of the utmost importance
from the very beginning to familiarise
the colt with certain words to indicate what you
require of him. As soon as he has learnt to
start on his circular trip and continue it without
much fuss, you must leave off and take him
back to his loose box, and on no account keep
him at his work until he is really tired, or he
will soon become disgusted with it and will not
exert himself on future occasions, or he may
turn sulky, which is worse. After placing him
in his box again, leave him to himself with food
and water within his reach. In the afternoon
you may give him another lesson of from
<a id="png.p025" href="#png.p025"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>three-quarters to an hour in length, according to
circumstances. On the following day you can
teach him to lead.</p>

<p>Take the colt on to the longeing ground and
make him circle round you; after a time, when
the animal has sobered down a little, you can
take in the cavasson by degrees while you walk
round in small circles to the colt’s larger radius;
keep on decreasing the distance between yourself
and the colt until you are within a few feet
of him, and then continue walking round with
him as before for a few turns, when you can
take in all the remaining length of cavasson and
walk on as before, but with this difference, that
at first you stood still, being in fact a fixed
point representing the centre of the circle, then
you described small circles to his larger ones,
whilst now you are walking side by side with
him. Talk to him and pat him, but be very
gentle for fear he should take fright and pull
away from you. After the colt has become
accustomed to this and has gone round quietly
a few times with you, you may by pushing
<a id="png.p026" href="#png.p026"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>against him, gradually cause him imperceptibly
to move in another circle, that is, with him
nearest the centre, whilst before he had been
farthest from that point, and so you change
his legs and prevent him from tiring.</p>

<p>Keep changing the direction of the circle
from time to time, and when you think he has
learnt how to lead in a circle, or that he is getting
tired, you can lead him back to his box by
<em>circles</em>. Do not attempt as yet to induce him
to<!-- TN: original reads "to to" --> be led in a straight line, for if you do he is
almost sure to fight; he cannot be made to
understand everything at once. So far he has
been taught to lead in a circle by stratagem,
and by stratagem he will also be taught to lead
in a straight line, but this must take place by
degrees, being postponed to a future day.</p>

<p>Leave him in his loose box until the afternoon,
when you can longe him again, and then
by degrees shorten the cavasson as before and
lead him in circles as in the morning, but do
not keep him out more than an hour, after
which take him back again in circles. On the
<a id="png.p027" href="#png.p027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>next day you may teach the colt to lead straight.
Take him on to the longeing ground and run
him round a few times until he has got rid of
his exuberant spirits, then do as before and
lead him round in circles, changing the direction
of the circles from time to time, by degrees
enlarging them; then, instead of leading him
round an entire circle, make semicircles, that is
to say, a half circle one way and then a half
circle in the opposite direction, and so on, so
that the <em>centres</em> of these semicircles will be in a
straight line. Thus by degrees you can diminish
the <em>short</em> diameters of these semicircles, at the
same time increasing their <em>long</em> diameters in
length, so as to form semi-ovals, and by continuing
to lengthen them you will in time have
imperceptibly gained a <em>straight</em> line. When you
have to turn him do so in a sweeping curve,
and gradually get him into the straight line
again. Keep him at this some time, for this
walking exercise will not tire him, and he will
get used to you and to his work. In the afternoon
you can repeat the lesson, and also on the
<a id="png.p028" href="#png.p028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>day or two following, until he leads well. On the
second day of leading him in a straight line
you should carry a whip, to teach him always
to walk with his shoulder opposite yours; his
head should always be in front of you, and
your body should be level with his fore-arm
and shoulder, otherwise if you allow his head
to be level with you he will by degrees hang
back, and you will teach him to drag on you,
and for ever afterwards when being led you
will have to <em>pull</em> him along. To prevent this
fault you must lead him with the cavasson in
your right hand, and with your left hand containing
the whip, whenever his shoulder drops
behind yours, you must strike him gently <em>behind</em>
you, when he will come into his proper position
immediately. By doing this and watching him
carefully, you will in a few days teach him to
lead well, keep his shoulder always level with
yours, and not hang back, and thus prevent him
in after days from being <em>pulled</em> along, and save
him much ill-usage and beating. In two or three
days he will lead well, and then you may put
<a id="png.p029" href="#png.p029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the tackling on him, which will consist of a
roller, a crupper, and a bit. The roller is
nothing more than a surcingle having that part
which corresponds to the saddle well padded,
having on each side of it on a level with the
sides of the withers a buckle for the reins, and
behind, in the centre line, a D for the crupper,
which should near the tail have a buckle on the
near side of it, or it may be as well to have one
on either side. The buckle greatly facilitates
placing the crupper under the tail, as it can be
put round its root easily, instead of having to
be drawn over its whole length from the tip to
the root, hair and all.</p>

<p>As to the best bit, everyone has his particular
fancy in this respect. Some advocate a
large smooth snaffle, with keys depending from
its central ring; others a large smooth straight
bit; others a straight bit with rollers on its mouthpiece;
others a large straight bit the mouthpiece
of which is of wood; others a circular bit
consisting of a smooth ring with a loop on its
upper surface at either side for its attachment
<a id="png.p030" href="#png.p030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to the bridle, whilst others again believe in a
bit having a smooth semicircular mouthpiece.
I will now mention these bits in their reverse
order. The semicircular bit being only a modification
of the circular, I may treat the two
as one. Allowing, as they do, no relief to the
gums and mouth, through their continued pressure
on them, they are not qualified to give a
colt a good mouth, but at the same time they
are most admirable bits for the use of grooms
leading horses out for exercise, or even for the
horses they ride during exercise, as they are
least calculated to spoil a mouth of any bits
with which I am acquainted, and as it is a
notorious fact that almost every groom (and a
good many gentlemen too) hangs on by the bit
instead of by the muscular power of his legs, of
course the bit which is least severe on a horse’s
mouth, and calculated to do least damage to
it, is the best. Therefore I can confidently
recommend both these bits for exercise work,
watering bridles, and in fact for any stable
work.</p>

<p><a id="png.p031" href="#png.p031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The straight bit having a wooden mouthpiece
I also object to, for by being softened with
the saliva in the mouth, it is easily torn and
roughened during the process of ‘champing,’
(for every colt will play with his bit as a rule,)
and whenever it comes in contact with his teeth
a wooden bit is more or less lacerated, thus
presenting a roughened surface, which is anything
but conducive to the formation of a good
mouth.</p>

<p>The next on the list is a straight bit with
smooth rollers or rings on its mouth-piece,
which are for the purpose of preventing the colt
from sliding his mouth from one side of the bit
to the other. This may be all very well in
theory, but here prevention is <em>not</em> better than
cure, for the colt will so injure his lips and
gums as to make him either hard-mouthed or
extremely sensitive, so much so in fact that the
least pull on his mouth will make him throw
up his head instantly, and thus not being able
to see where he is going to is the cause of
many an accident. This is the bit which brings
<a id="png.p032" href="#png.p032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>martingales so much into use, from its having
been used during the so-called mouthing of the
colt.</p>

<p>The next bit under consideration is the
large, smooth, straight one, with keys hanging
from its centre. So far I have condemned all
the bits I have mentioned, but this one will not
allow of a mere mention and then a dismissal,
it having its strong points, and in my opinion,
its weak ones also. Its advocates say it prevents
the colt from being mouthed irregularly,
or in other words that the colt cannot relieve
the pressure on its mouth by alternately leaning
on either side of the bit. This, I must say, is
not reasonable, for if the animal only arches his
neck a little more, and turns his head to the
right when he is tied with the reins to the
roller, the pressure of the bit will be on the <em>left</em>
side, thus relieving the right side, and <i>vice versâ</i>.
Again, these bits seldom fit the colt’s mouth,
and consequently they either pinch and hurt
the mouth, or are much too wide, which is
generally the case, thus teaching the animal to
<a id="png.p033" href="#png.p033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>slide his mouth on it from side to side, for
which trick the straight mouth-piece with rings
has been invented for its eradication. When I
say that the colt can, by keeping his tongue
more or less elevated in his mouth, prevent all
pressure of this bit on his gums and lips, I
think I may pass it over as incompetent for the
object in view, namely a good mouth.</p>

<p>The next, and last bit to be considered is
the large smooth snaffle, with keys depending
from its central ring.</p>

<p>I consider this to be the best bit as yet invented
for mouthing a colt. No movement of
the tongue can raise it from the gums or lips,
the colt can play with it with ease, and seems
to enjoy it, instead of continually fighting with
it more or less, as he does with the others
already mentioned, with the exception of the
circular or semicircular bits. Some people
may say it causes an unequal mouth, but I
maintain that it does not, for if, as already described,
the animal arches his neck and turns
his head to the right, undoubtedly the <em>pressure</em>
<a id="png.p034" href="#png.p034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the bit will be on the left side, but the <em>weight</em>
of the right half of the bit will still be on the
right side of the mouth, which cannot be the
case with a straight mouth-piece. Again, it is
not of so much consequence as to whether this
sort of bit fits the colt’s mouth or not, provided
it is placed in the proper place in the mouth, as
the weights of each half depending from their
centres will keep the pressure on both sides
equal. The great mistake made in mouthing a
colt is that the animal is tied up too long with
the bit in his mouth, for when muscular contraction
is exhausted he is forced through sheer
fatigue to <em>lean upon the bit</em>, and thus lay the
stepping stone to a hard mouth.</p>

<p>Men think now-a-days they can mouth a
colt by machinery. They tie his head up and
down in the most intricate manner, put a great
bit in his mouth, and if the bit is not considered
heavy enough, a bag of shot is tied to each side
of it. The animal is then forced to stand in a
stall with his head tightly buckled up to the
roller, and there he is made to stand, fastened
<a id="png.p035" href="#png.p035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to the pillar reins, in a fixed position for hours
at a time. No wonder that half the horses in
England have mouths like cast-iron. Colts
cannot be mouthed by machinery, but only by
proper handling in the saddle. It is of no use
going through all the elaborate process now in
vogue of <em>stable</em> mouthing, india-rubber dumb
jockeys, reins, &amp;c. It is the man’s <em>hands</em> only
which can do so, but at the same time I must
confess it is a difficult thing to find a man with
good and light hands. Perhaps this system of
mechanical mouthing may have had something
to do with hardening men’s hands as well as
horses’ mouths.</p>

<p>I may now describe the proper position
for the bit in the mouth. It should not be
drawn up tightly into the angle of the lips,
neither should it be so slack as to be among
the incisor teeth, but it should be exactly opposite
the <em>groove</em> in the chin where the curb-chain
ought to be when used. I think I need not
tell my readers how to put the roller on the
colt; the only things required are to take time,
<a id="png.p036" href="#png.p036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be as gentle as possible, and take care not to
buckle it on tight at first, but leave it loose for
the first two or three days. To put the crupper
on, all that is required is to unbuckle it on the
near side, elevate the tail, place it in its proper
position, and then buckle it up again. There
will be no trouble in placing the roller or
crupper on the colt if he has been previously
treated as advocated by me, for by this time he
will have become tolerably quiet through having
been gently handled daily. Most people
fasten the bit to the head-stall, which I object
to; for when you lead or longe the colt the
cavasson is attached to the nose-band either
before, behind, or on either side of it, which
necessarily must displace the bit more or less;
therefore I much prefer a bridle with the bit
attached to be placed under the head-stall, when
there will be no fear of displacing the bit. Do
not fasten reins to the bit for the first day or
two, but lead the colt out without them, for he
will have enough to do to get used to the
constraint of bit, roller, and crupper. When
<a id="png.p037" href="#png.p037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>you have placed the tackling on the young
animal, you may let him stand in the loose box
for half-an-hour to familiarise himself with the
objects on his body, when he can be taken to
the longing ground, and run round for a time
in different directions, after which lead him
about for an hour or two. In the afternoon
you can longe him a little, and then lead him
out of the field and take him along a road or
lane to accustom him to see and pass strange
objects. The road selected for his first lesson
should be the quietest that can be found near
the longing ground. When he is startled at a
heap of stones, a log of wood, or any other
object, he must be spoken to quietly and patted,
but above all allow him plenty of time to examine
minutely the object which has frightened
him, when, after a time, he will approach it,
smell it, and touch it with his nose, thus allaying
all his fears; he may then be led backwards
and forwards past the place a few times, and
proceed on his journey. For the day following
you will have to longe him, and then lead him
<a id="png.p038" href="#png.p038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>along the road both morning and afternoon.
Always commence the day’s work by longeing,
so as to take some of the ‘gas’ out of the colt
and sober him down a little before he begins
his daily lessons, otherwise he will be so full of
play as to pay no attention to your teaching.
On the third day you may attach reins to the
bit and buckle them to the roller, but be sure
you leave them very slack; you may also lead
him about in more frequented roads, and if he
has been tolerably quiet so far, you can take
him through a village or town, and thus accustom
him to objects in a new sphere of life.
For a fortnight after the first tackling took
place, your work will be to lead him about
roads, towns, and even take him to railway
stations to get accustomed to the trains. Take
the reins up a hole every other day until his
head is carried perpendicularly, but then stop,
do not take them up the eighth of an inch
more. At the expiration of the fortnight you
must longe him with the cavasson attached
alternately to either side of the bit, so as to
<a id="png.p039" href="#png.p039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>teach the animal side pressure, for so far he has
only been undergoing direct pressure. It is as
well to count how many circles he goes on one
side of the bit, and then give him a corresponding
number on the other to prevent his mouth
becoming one-sided or, in other words, having
one side of his mouth <em>more</em> or <em>less</em> sensitive than
the other. Do not keep him at this long, or his
mouth will become very tender and sore, but
occupy the remainder of the time in leading
about the roads &amp;c. Continue doing this for
two or three days, and then, having procured
long reins, drive him about on the longing
ground or in a field, turning him from time to
time from one side to the other, stopping him
every now and then to get him accustomed to
his work, and if you do not pull at him too
much, but allow him plenty of play with his
head, he will in two or three days have a very
fair mouth. After the first day of using reins
you may drive him about the roads instead of
leading him.</p>

<p>Of course, during all this time—in fact,
<a id="png.p040" href="#png.p040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>from the haltering of the colt—you will have
been freely handling him daily, lifting first his
fore-feet and striking them with your hand, at
first gently, to get him used to the hammer, and
afterwards, when this has been accomplished
with facility, the same has been done to the
hind ones; and after the colt has been taught
to drive in reins, it is time he was shod preparatory
to mounting him.</p>

<p>In mouthing a colt he should never be
placed in a stall and fastened to the pillar reins,
as is too often the practice now-a-days, for it
only teaches him to lean upon the bit and
slide his mouth from one side of it to the other,
thus teaching him a habit to counteract which
the ringed mouthpiece has been invented. A
day should be fixed for shoeing the colt, and
an arrangement made with the blacksmith to
shoe him at a certain hour; for if this is neglected,
the animal may have to wait his turn
whilst three or four other horses are undergoing
the process. Before taking him to the blacksmith’s
shop at the hour appointed, the colt
<a id="png.p041" href="#png.p041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>must be well longed so as to get him sobered
down a little; and if he is a very nervous
fidgety animal, he should be longed until he is
really tired. If on arriving at the shop the
blacksmith is not quite ready for him, do not
tie him up, but lead him up and down until
he is wanted; and then, during the process of
shoeing, stand by him and do all you can to
soothe and allay his fears, at the same time
taking care that the smith performs his work as
quietly as possible. If he is very refractory,
get his fore-feet shod and leave the hind ones
for the following day.</p>

<p>After the colt has been shod and has been
driven about the roads in reins for a few days
to get him used to going in shoes, he may be
got ready for mounting, but that will require a
fresh chapter.</p>

 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER III.<br
 ><small>SADDLING THE COLT.</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> colt must now be saddled. Allow him
first to look at, smell, and feel the saddle,
then place it gently on his back, draw the
girths up, at first very slackly, put on the
crupper with the buckle as before, and a
breastplate. I object to a martingale, my
reason for which I shall mention further on.
At first do not put on any stirrup-straps or
stirrups, as they will only act as alarmants to
the colt. After petting him for a time in the
loose box, tighten the girths moderately, and
lead him out for a time, and then longe him
to accustom him to the flapping of the saddle;
after which drive him about the roads with
the saddle on. Repeat this in the afternoon.
<a id="png.p046" href="#png.p046"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>46<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>On the following day do as before, but attach
stirrup-irons and straps to the saddle; you may
also fasten a strap on either side of the flank
to the crupper, so as to get the animal used
to having objects touching and dangling from
him. Repeat this in the afternoon, and also
on the following day, when the colt will be
ready for mounting.</p>

<p>Before mounting, longe the colt well with
the saddle on, then take him back to his loose
box, and put on a French, or as some people
call it, a Dutch martingale, consisting simply
of a couple of rings joined together, through
which the reins pass. To make this clearer
for such of my readers who may not have seen
one, I will describe how this is done. Unfasten
the buckle in the centre of the reins, and pass
each rein through a different ring, then buckle
the reins together again over the withers, the
rings or French martingale will then be between
the colt’s chin and his breast. I much prefer
this French martingale to the one in ordinary
use, which has two straps with rings at their
<a id="png.p047" href="#png.p047"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>extremities buckled on to the breastplate,
through which the reins pass, for with the
former you are able to steady the colt’s head
without constraining it, which is the worst
thing you can do when first riding a young
animal; while the latter fixes the head too
much in one position, and also tends to make
him carry it far too low, when all attempts to
mouth him are useless, for the bit will then be
in the <em>angle of the lips</em>, the very place where it
ought not to be.</p>

<p>There is also a danger should the colt fight
much, especially with his fore-feet, of their
becoming entangled in the martingale or reins.
Men put the common martingale on when
riding a young colt, for the simple reason that
it gives them a good purchase, and thus enables
them to hold on; a man who requires this
aid to keep him in the saddle should never
attempt to break-in a colt, that is, if he wishes
him to have a good mouth, or one only a little
removed from cast-iron. If a man can sit a
colt without any pressure on the reins, he will
<a id="png.p048" href="#png.p048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>probably be able to mouth the animal well,
provided he has certain other qualities, such
as patience, knack, &amp;c., for a man who can
retain his seat without the aid of the reins
has, as a general rule, light hands; while on
the contrary, the man who relies upon the reins
to secure him his seat in the saddle, has neither
hands nor seat, and the sooner he contents
himself with riding the horse nature gave him—to
wit, his own legs—the better, for he will
only spoil every horse he crosses, provided they
have not been already spoilt by some other
bad rider.</p>

<p>To return to the subject. After having put
on the ring martingale, see that everything is
right about the colt. Look to the girths, that
they may not be slack, see that the crupper is
neither too tight or too loose, and that no
hairs have gathered under it, and satisfy yourself
that everything is as it ought to be, even
to the buckles of the bridle. Then gathering
up the reins in your left hand, and standing
with your left side to his shoulder, place your
<a id="png.p049" href="#png.p049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>left foot in the stirrup, and gradually bear
weight upon it, when after a while you may
raise yourself in the stirrup, so that both your
legs are off the ground. You must watch
minutely every movement of the animal, and
speak gently and soothingly to him. After
standing in the stirrup for a few seconds, lower
yourself to the ground again, and then repeat
the same a few times, until the colt seems quiet
and used to it, when you may throw your right
leg gently over his back, taking care not to
touch him with it, and placing all your weight
on your right hand, grasping the pommel of
the saddle. When your leg is over his back,
lower it quietly into its proper position, but
keep it from touching the animal’s side until
you have gently seated yourself in the saddle,
then put your foot in the stirrup and there you
are. Now do not spoil everything by trying
to make the colt progress, but sit still, talk to
him, pat him, and do everything you can to
pacify the animal, and get him used to seeing
you take such liberties with him as sitting on
<a id="png.p050" href="#png.p050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his back; for, mind you, he feels an insult as
much as you do. If a stranger were to jump
on your back, you would immediately resent
it by trying to get him off, and by fighting him;
but if a friend were to do the same thing you
would laugh, and if you did not exactly enjoy the
joke, at any rate you would not resent it. The
same with the colt. If you get on his back and
urge him forward, he thinks you are taking
a liberty, and as such are an enemy, and therefore
tries his best to get rid of you; but on
the other hand, if you sit still and speak kindly
to him, he will recognise your action as that
of a friend, although he may not actually laugh.
After having sat on him a few minutes, you
may get off, but very quietly, so as not to
frighten him. Release your right foot from the
stirrup, keep the leg from the animal’s side,
and raise it to a level with his back, then
gradually lower it on the near side until you
are standing in the near stirrup. Pause here a
few seconds, make much of him, and then lower
yourself to the ground, take your left foot out
<a id="png.p051" href="#png.p051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the stirrup, and then handle and fondle the
colt. Repeat this a few times, and then lead
him out to the longing ground, as that most
familiar to him, and where he has learnt his
several acts of subordination, which latter is
not the least beneficial aid, for he will recognise
it as the scene of such to you. You must
now mount him in the same quiet manner as
before, but sit still, talk to him, and above all
do not urge him forward, for if you do he will
generally fight, plunge, rear, buck or kick, and
then unless you are a good rider he will send
you sprawling on mother earth. A fight at
this juncture should always be avoided, for if
he throws you he will know he is the conqueror,
and will most likely be a kicker, a
rearer, &amp;c., for some time to come, if not for
life; but, on the other hand, if you get the
better of him it may so cow him that it will
be a long time before he gets out of the sulks,
or he may be a ‘slug’ and mean-spirited horse
for the remainder of his days. Therefore avoid
making him worse, for if you only give him
<a id="png.p052" href="#png.p052"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>time he will most likely walk off of his own
accord, and if on the longing ground will probably
walk or jig-jog round the circular track
through sheer custom, or he may take a path
of his own, but whether he chooses the circular
path or one of his own, do not check him, but
allow him to go where he likes for a time, of
course gradually sheering him off with the
reins until he goes where <em>you</em> like. Do not
pull at him, let him have all the reins you can,
your only control being gradual guidance from
side to side. Never mind his taking large
corners, you are not mouthing him as yet, but
getting him used to carry you, and by degrees
cajoling him into going where you require him.
You must not force him, or there will be an
open fight, which is to be avoided for the first
few days after first mounting, but little by
little cause him to go in your direction, but so
imperceptibly as to make him believe it is of
his own free will he is going there.</p>

<p>It has been my theory from the commencement
of this little treatise so to work as to
<a id="png.p053" href="#png.p053"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cajole and manœuvre the colt into following
your wishes, that they are so imperceptibly
gained that he does not notice them as acts of
actual obedience, for they have come upon him
in so gradual a manner that there having been
no fight over the matter he imagines the actions
to have been of his own free will. Of course
there must be an open rupture sooner or later
which will undeceive him, but this should be
avoided with all possible care until he has been
mounted a week if possible. Ride the animal
about the field for an hour or an hour and a
half quietly, not going out of a walk or jig-jog,
and then take him back to his loose box, and
repeat the same in the afternoon, your object
at present being to get him used to your
weight on his back, and to gradual guidance;
you are not trying to mouth him, or attempting
to teach him his paces. ‘Little by little,’
and ‘Perseverando,’ are my mottoes, and ought
to be those of every man who undertakes to
break-in a colt. It is very much like bringing
up a child; you cannot give a child an adult’s
<a id="png.p054" href="#png.p054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>thoughts at one lesson, or teach him right from
wrong, but must continue it over a long course
of years; and if you correct a child harshly, or
beat him without showing where his fault lies
and reasoning with him, he will either show
fight as best he can—for he does not <em>understand</em>
what he has done wrong or <em>why</em> it is wrong—or
else he turns sulky and broods over his
wrongs, which latter I hold to be worse than
the former; and this holds good in the horse,
for a sulky colt is much harder to overcome
and requires much more patience than one
which breaks out in open fight, for when the
fight is over it is over, but with a sulky one
there is no knowing how long it may last. As
it is best to reason with a child, and prove to
him that he is wrong, instead of whipping him,
so is it best to teach a horse by degrees what
is required of him, for he cannot be reasoned
with, but must learn step by step the lessons
given him. If you endeavour to teach him
too much at once, or in too rapid strides, he
<em>cannot understand</em>, and therefore when you
<a id="png.p055" href="#png.p055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>punish or reprimand him he turns sulky, or
shows fight, and very naturally too, for he does
not know why he has been punished after
doing his best to please you.</p>

<p>Ride the colt for the three following days
(morning and afternoon) about the field so as
to avoid a fight with him caused by passing
carriages, carts, or any other objects which
might alarm him, and by so doing he will
gradually become accustomed to the guidance
of the reins and understand the pressure of the
heels and other little signs, imparting to him
the pace and direction in which he is to move,
after which he can be ridden on the road. It
is best to select a good wide road, and to avoid
all narrow ones and lanes for a time, until he is
handy at passing vehicles &amp;c., for if you meet
a cart in a lane there is very little room for him
to pass it by, and as he is almost sure to dance
about a little there is always some danger of
his hurting himself against the wheel or some
projecting part of the cart; but on the other
hand, if the road be wide there is no such
<a id="png.p056" href="#png.p056"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>danger, and he will also be got past any object
which may frighten him much easier, and the
chances of having a fight with him are thus
reduced to a minimum. Always avoid a fight
if possible by every means in your power, for
instance, if a carriage is coming very fast towards
you, either from behind or in front, and
you think it calculated to frighten your pupil
very much, you can by raising your hand
show the coachman that you wish him to drive
quietly until he has passed you, and you will
find that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
he is civil enough to comply with your mute
request, but the hundredth <span class="nw">deserves——</span> Well,
perhaps the less said about his deserts the
better, for I suppose it is impossible to find a
flock of human beings without one black sheep
amongst them, above all amongst grooms and
coachmen, who as a class are the most ignorant
and bigoted men on the face of the earth; there
are, however, some few trustworthy excellent
men among them, but they are very few and
far between.</p>

<p><a id="png.p057" href="#png.p057"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>If on nearing a heap of stones or any other
object, such as a woman’s petticoat or other
garments drying on a hedge, at which the colt
seems inclined to be frightened, do not flog him
past but speak kindly to him and pat him, do
not hurry, but let the animal take his own time,
and you will find by degrees that he will take
a step or two towards it, and at last get close
to and possibly touch it with his nose after
having smelt it; then you must ride him backwards
and forwards past it a few times, and
when he has ceased to notice it continue on
your way. You will of course have a fight
some time or other, for the colt may wish at
some cross roads to choose one for himself,
irrespective of any choice on your part, or he
may wish to follow some horse on the road
before him, and refuse to leave an animal feeding
by the roadside, but in whichever mode he
disputes your authority you must undeceive
him, and that <em>thoroughly and at once</em>. If he
requires whip and spur, let him have them,
but remember, never allow him to get the upper
<a id="png.p058" href="#png.p058"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hand of you, for if so, you may just as well
turn him out and leave off breaking, until you
have found a man who <em>can</em> master him, for he
will have found out his own strength and will
not forget it in a hurry. If it takes you half a
day or even a whole one to make him do as
you wish, it will be time well spent.</p>

<p>After having ridden him for a fortnight, you
may discontinue the mouthing bit, and in its
stead use an ordinary plain snaffle, taking care
to select as large a one as possible, for if it is
too fine it will hurt the animal’s mouth, and
either render it dull or extremely sensitive.</p>

<p>If a colt is well broken at first there will be
no necessity in after life to resort to such means
as those which Rarey introduced, or the dodging
process of M. Carriès as mentioned in the ‘Pall
Mall Gazette,’ the paragraph concerning which
I here <span class="nw">reproduce:—</span></p>

<p>‘<span class="smc">Horse Taming.</span>—History repeats itself in
horse-taming, it appears, as well as in other
matters. Mr. Rarey and Cruiser have met with
their match in M. Carriès and Trocadéro.
<a id="png.p059" href="#png.p059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Trocadéro, son of Monarque and Antonio, has of
late exhibited symptoms of the most fearful
ferocity; and “about two months ago,” according
to “Le Sport,” M. Aumont “met M. Carriès,” who offered to tame the animal.
M. Aumont, having inquired whether the
means employed would not be drugs or such
violence as might injure the horse or render
him still more furious, and having received an
assurance that nothing of the kind would be
used, he consented; and, at a time agreed upon,
a visit was paid to the stud at Victat-Pontfol, and
the experiments began. The first thing was to
enter the horse-box. This M. Carriès did, in
presence of M. Aumont and all the “stable,”
who “s’attendait à le voir dévoré.” An exciting
“duel” ensued; the horse rushing, time after
time, with open mouth and with “hennissements
féroces,” at M. Carriès, who merely dodged him
by rapid movements aside, as the toreador
dodges the bull. After ten of these attacks so
met, “the animal suddenly stopped to contemplate
the audacious individual who braved
<a id="png.p060" href="#png.p060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>him in this manner, and was at once seized with
the nervous trembling which comes over ‘le
lutteur aux prises avec un adversaire contre
lequel ses moyens habituels ont échoué. Trocadéro
était dompté!’” And M. Carriès took
advantage of the horse’s stupor to put a saddle
and bridle upon him, after which Trocadéro
submitted like a lamb to have his fore-feet shod,
and ultimately his hind-feet, without more ado.
The dodging process of M. Carriès certainly
beats for simplicity even the throwing-down
process of Mr. Rarey; but it might be awkward
if the tamer were to meet with a horse less
susceptible of “stupeur” than Trocadéro appears
to be. The question suggested by all these
horse-taming feats, however, is whether they
could not be rendered altogether unnecessary by
care taken in the original training, and whether,
as regards the trainer and the method he adopts
towards his four-legged pupils, the gist of the
whole matter does not lie in what has been said
by a French authority:—“S’il est brutal, le poulain
deviendra farouche, violent, et méfiant; si,
<a id="png.p061" href="#png.p061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>au contraire, il sait mettre l’animal en confiance,
la bonne entente s’établira promptement.” It
certainly seems that, if a horse in his years of
discretion, or rather maturity, and of confirmed
viciousness, can be tamed so readily by a resolute
but gentle master, there ought to be little or
no difficulty in training him up during foalhood,
like Captain Cuttle’s fig-tree, in the way he
should go, so that when he is old he would not
depart from it.’</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER IV.<br
 ><small>TEACHING THE COLT HIS PACES.</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Now</span> that the colt has been mounted and more
or less mouthed during his fortnight’s road
work, he must be taught his paces, viz., how to
walk, trot, canter, and gallop properly. Ambling,
pacing, and running not being in vogue
in this country, I shall make no mention of
them.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Walk.</span>—It is of great importance to
teach a horse to walk well; there is nothing
more disagreeable than riding a horse that
walks as if he was crawling to his own funeral,
or one which will not walk, but prefers to
shake the life out of you with a jig-jog. People
in this country do not place so much value on
the walk as they would if they had long journeys
to go. The Australians, on the contrary,
<a id="png.p066" href="#png.p066"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>who live in the saddle, appreciate a good walking
horse, and will give a good deal more for a
walker than they will for one that is not. An
Australian may be travelling a long distance,
or in search of lost sheep, cattle, or horses;
in either case the pace would be slow, and probably
the distance covered daily from forty to
forty-five miles, or perhaps more, and to ride a
horse day after day for this distance, which will
not walk, but only jig-jog, is simply martyrdom.
Therefore those men who break-in horses for
their own use take very great pains to teach
them to walk well. In England the average
pace of a horse which has any pretensions to
walking is about four miles an hour, and I
very much doubt if the best ever get to five.
In Australia, where horses are <em>educated</em> to walk,
good walkers can do their six miles an hour.
The Americans <em>educate</em> their horses to trot, and
beat us at that pace. A good Australian walking
horse will be able to keep up five miles an
hour for the distance of twenty miles; and for
a long distance, say a journey of two or three
<a id="png.p067" href="#png.p067"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hundred miles, doing from thirty to fifty miles
daily, he will walk four and a half<!-- TN: original reads "a-half" --> miles an
hour. In fact a bushman knows to a mile how
far he has gone by consulting his watch only,
for he is able to tell through experience the
pace his horse is walking at, just in the same
way that a jockey judges the speed of his race-horse.
At all the largest horse-shows in the
Australian Colonies, special prizes are given for
the best walking horses.</p>

<p>To teach a horse to walk well is a very
easy matter, only requiring patience, time, and
a certain amount of knack. The reins must
not be drawn up tightly, but on the contrary
they must be slack, and only so drawn up as
just to feel the colt’s mouth and no more. A
horse cannot extend himself and walk fast if
he has not his head, which holds good with respect
to any pace, for a horse can neither gallop,
trot, or walk at his best, if his head is confined.
When commencing to teach a horse to walk,
the only thing to be done is to prevent him
from indulging in the jig-jog; and to prevent
<a id="png.p068" href="#png.p068"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>this every time he does so, he must be brought
up to the walk again by means of pressure on
the bit. No endeavour should now be made
at fast walking; the only thing to be done is to
make him walk in <em>some</em> style or other, and to
prevent him from breaking. A man who is
used to this work will <em>feel</em> the colt is going to
break, or wants to do so, and so will be in
readiness to prevent him, or at least prevent
him breaking badly. It will take a month or
more before the colt is tolerably free from
breaking, but as soon as he has got to understand
he is not to do so, and his breaks grow
less in number, he may be taught to increase
the speed of his walk by pressure of the heel
or spur. You should not use a whip, for it
generally causes them to break. As soon as he
has recovered his break, slack the reins again
and urge him to his fastest walk, which in time
will be double what it was at first. The colt
should not be sickened of one pace, but after
walking a mile he must be trotted or cantered
for half a mile, and then drawn up to the walk
<a id="png.p069" href="#png.p069"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>again. When a colt is being taught his paces,
he should not be out long; if he gets an hour
of it twice daily, and is made to do his best all
the time, it will be plenty for him. When he is
walking he must be made to do his best, and
when he gets a trot or canter to rest him from
walking, he should be made to do that also in
his best form. By so doing he is taught to
exert himself, and to learn that he must not
move in a slovenly manner, and at the same
time, although the chief subject at present is to
teach him to walk, he is also being initiated
into the proper method of trotting and cantering.
Although he will, in three or four
months, be a fair walker, it will be a year, or
perhaps two, before he has attained perfection.
The Americans do not count months, but years,
in educating a horse to trot. To get a horse
at his best pace requires time, and time and
patience alone can accomplish it.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Trot.</span>—There are three kinds of trot:
the jog-trot or jig-jog, the true trot, and the
flying-trot. The jog-trot is a most uncomfortable
<a id="png.p070" href="#png.p070"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pace, and is not faster than a walk; the
flying-trot is that indulged in by the Americans,
and by our own countrymen in trotting-matches,
but as the true trot is the only one used by the
bulk of the people in this country, I shall confine
myself to describing the method of teaching
the colt the proper mode of progressing in that
pace. The jog-trot is a modification of the
true trot, whilst the flying-trot is an exaggeration
of it; therefore the true trot is the medium,
and the best for all purposes with the exception
of race trotting.</p>

<p>To teach a colt the true trot, the reins
should not be held slack as in walking, but
should be well gathered up to make the animal
place his hind legs well under him, and also
cause him to lift his fore limbs higher, thus
giving him knee action; the great beauty and
comfort in the trot being free action, and as
an extreme pace is not required, comfort and
looks are placed in the scale against flying
speed. The animal should be urged forward
by voice, heel, or spur, at the same time being
<a id="png.p071" href="#png.p071"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>kept in check by the bit; he is thus forced to
expend his increased exertions in the air, or in
other words, he will trot with higher action,
although his speed will be little or no faster
than before. He should not be trotted more
than half a mile at a time, but whilst trotting
must do so in his best form, and when walked
between his trots, he must do that also in his
best style.</p>

<p>What I have already said under the head
of walking, with reference to the time to be
occupied daily in teaching a colt his paces,
applies equally to the trot and other paces, for
a colt, if tired, cannot be taught his paces, and
will only be spoilt if persevered with when
fatigued; therefore make him do his best all
the time, at whatever different paces he is put,
but avoid tiring him.</p>

<p>The off fore-leg is the best to teach him to
lead off with; but some horses go easier, and
with more comfort to their riders, when leading
with the near fore; therefore I do not think a
rule can be laid down as to which is invariably
<a id="png.p072" href="#png.p072"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the best, but after having ridden the colt a
little time you will soon find out which way
he goes best, for I think it a pity, if he goes
best with his near fore first, just for the sake of
fashion, to alter it to the off fore; for although
it is easy to teach him to lead with the off leg, it
will never have the same easy and free motion
it had when using the near, which in this particular
case nature seemed to have intended
for that purpose. Again, some horses will
trot equally well with either leg leading. If
the colt is being taught for a lady’s riding, he
must lead with his off fore-leg.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Canter.</span>—By some writers the canter
is described as a thoroughly artificial pace, but
why, I am unable to understand. The <em>true</em>
canter is nothing more than a slow gallop, as is
the gallop an extended and fast canter, the difference
between the two paces being a matter
of <em>speed</em>. If the style of movement of some
ladies’ horses which go with a sort of hop
and a shuffle, which is generally termed a
canter, is <em>the</em> canter alluded to by these
<a id="png.p073" href="#png.p073"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>authors, then I acknowledge it <em>is</em> an artificial
pace, and one very tiring to the animal as well
as very prejudicial to his soundness, and, to
my mind, very ugly to boot. If ladies must
ride rocking-horses, they would be much better
supplied with wooden ones, which could be
kept at much less cost, requiring neither food,
shoeing, nor grooming, whilst the wear and
tear of the habit would be much reduced,
owing to the lack of mud thrown up. Luckily
we seldom see one of these hopping, shuffling
brutes, which by some are supposed to be the
perfection of a lady’s horse.</p>

<p>The colt is taught to canter by urging him
forward, the meanwhile restraining him with
the bit. In the canter as in the trot, true action
is required, and for the same reason, namely,
that speed not being requisite, comfort and
beauty of pace take its place, which can only
be accomplished by having the hind legs well
drawn under the body, and the knees well
elevated and flexed. If the colt is for a gentleman
to ride, I do not think it matters which
<a id="png.p074" href="#png.p074"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fore-leg he leads with, for, as in the trot, some
animals lead better with one than the other;
but if for a lady, the colt should always be
taught to lead with his off fore, which is done
by drawing his head a little to the near side,
at the same time striking him with the whip on
the same side.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Gallop</span> is an extension or exaggeration
of the canter, the limbs not being elevated
so much as in the canter, but extended to a
greater extent, whilst the abdomen is brought
nearer to the ground. For ordinary galloping
the colt requires no teaching; only give him his
head, and urge him forward fast enough, and
he will gallop. For racing purposes the colt
must be taught to make the most of his gallop;
but as this is not a treatise on training, and as
the racing colt acquires his education under the
supervision of his trainer, I shall not enter
further into the subject.</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER V.<br
 ><small>THE ROAD HACK.</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">I will</span> here give a brief description of the
several classes of saddle-horses required in this
country for civil purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Road Hack</span>, worked as he is on hard
metal roads, cannot combine speed with durability,
as the rate of fourteen to eighteen miles
an hour would soon wear out his feet and legs,
when he would only be fit for a tradesman’s
cart or cab work, therefore a horse of this sort
should be a good walker, and be able to trot
from eight to twelve or fourteen miles an hour,
doing it with good, true, and level action, being
neither too high nor too low, for with low action
when he has gone some distance and begins to
feel tired he will trip over stones or inequalities
in the ground, and very possibly fall, and if the
<a id="png.p078" href="#png.p078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>action is too high he will soon batter his legs
and feet to pieces. With regard to make and
shape, he should be as near perfection as
possible, for without perfect symmetry no pace
can be at the height of excellence, but as perfect
conformation is seldom met with, its nearest
approach must be sought for.</p>

<p>The head should be small and fine, broad
between the eyes and between the branches of
the lower jaw at their angles, also the distance
from the eye to the angle of the lower jaw
should be great; the nostrils should be large,
wide, clean, and well-defined; the mouth small,
with the lips thin and firm; the ears should be
small, fine, and pointed, being carried firmly
with their tips inclining slightly towards each
other; the eye should be large, full, and prominent,
with well-developed arch. The neck
must be long, thin, and fit well into the space
formed between the branches of the lower jaw,
longer on its upper than its under surface, as
well as convex on its superior border. The head
should be well ‘set on’ to the neck, which, if
<a id="png.p079" href="#png.p079"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the jaws are wide and the neck of the proper
conformation will be the case, and add very
materially to the good mouth of the horse.
The withers must neither be too fine, thick, or
low, whilst a fine wither well clothed with
muscle, and yet not loaded, is perfection. The
mane should be fine, silky, and not too abundant.
The shoulder-blade must be long and
oblique, not straight, neither must it be coarse,
but blend gradually into the withers and back;
a coarse thick shoulder should always be
avoided, as also a very fine one, leaving the
withers to stand up by themselves like a plough-share,
for an animal with such shoulders will
soon tire, owing to insufficient muscular development
of the parts. The long oblique shoulder
gives plenty of space before the rider, the
saddle sits well provided the girth is also deep
and the action is pleasant, but if the shoulder
be straight or short, or a combination of both,
the saddle will be too forward, and when the
horse stumbles, as he is almost sure to do from
defective action due to this malconformation,
<a id="png.p080" href="#png.p080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he runs the chance of falling, breaking his
knees, and perhaps the neck of his rider as
well. The chest should be deep and moderately
broad, both being essential to the full development
of the functions of the heart and lungs.
The fore-arm must be long in proportion to the
leg, that is, the greater length in proportion
must be above the knee, and the less below it
the better; the muscular development of the
fore-arm should be as great as possible. The
elbow long and prominent, not ‘tied in,’ but
clear of the chest. The knee should be large,
wide, and prominent, but should appear more
or less flat when examined from in front; the
trapezium, or bone behind the knee, should also
be long and prominent. Avoid ‘calf’ knees,
and those which are bent forward. The cannon
or shank bone should be as short and strong as
possible, and perfectly straight, being neither
curved forwards, backwards, or laterally: the
tendons at the posterior aspect of this bone
should stand well out from it, which will be
the case when the trapezium is well developed;
<a id="png.p081" href="#png.p081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>there should be a distinct line of demarcation
between the tendons and the bone, but if this
is filled up the leg will be more or less round
instead of being broad and flat. Such legs
are called ‘gummy.’ The fetlock joint should
be large and flat laterally, its posterior
aspect being well-defined and prominent. The
pastern bones should neither be too long, short,
oblique, or straight. If the pastern is long it
is necessarily oblique, and therefore weak; if
short it is upright, and the severe concussion
so produced causes ringbones, windgalls, navicular
disease, &amp;c., besides causing the horse to
be rough and unpleasant to ride. The pastern
joint should be well developed and strong. The
feet, as regards the size, make and shape, &amp;c.,
of the horse should neither be too large nor too
small; the walls of the foot should form at the toe
an angle of about 45° with the ground; the sole
should be moderately concave, the frog large
and strong, and the whole hoof should be tough,
sound, and not brittle. The back should be
straight and not too long, a hollow back being
<a id="png.p082" href="#png.p082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>objectionable on account of its weakness, whilst
a roach back is very strong, although a horse
having a back of that conformation will be
rough to ride. The ribs should be long and
oval, and they should continue to be so up to
the very last, and the space between the last
rib and the ‘hooks’ should be capable of being
covered by the breadth of the hand. The hind
quarters must be long, deep, full, and broad,
as well as straight from the back to the tail,
the distance from the ‘hooks’ to the hocks
great, the stifle prominent, and the ‘second
thighs’ large and full. The hock should be
large and fine, without being coarse or having
any puffiness about it; the point of the hock
prominent, and the leg below the hock incline
a little under the body; it should neither be
perpendicular nor deviate laterally from the
perpendicular, or in other words, should not be
‘wide behind’ or ‘cow-hocked.’ Those parts
below the hocks may be compared with the
description of those below the knee. The tail
should be carried in a straight line from the
<a id="png.p083" href="#png.p083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>83<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>spinal chain and then droop in a graceful
curve.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Ladies’ Horse</span> should be cast in a longer
mould, or his body will be almost hidden by
the habit, therefore his neck must be long, and
his back longer than that of a man’s hack,
which will also give more elasticity to its paces.
He should be perfect in conformation, paces,
mouth, and temper, which if one may judge
by what one sees of ladies’ mounts in the Row,
is very seldom found, by far the greater number
being long-legged weeds or thick coarse carriage-horses,
as rough as an elephant, and often very
lame as well; in fact, they are horses that a man
would not ride himself if he possibly could help
it, but yet he considers them good enough for
his sisters, daughters, or wife. It is quite a
treat to see a really good lady’s horse amongst
the miscellaneous herd of nags to be found in
the Row during the season.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Cover Hack</span> is a cob of from fourteen to
fifteen hands high, capable of carrying his rider
to the meet at the rate of about sixteen miles
<a id="png.p084" href="#png.p084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>an hour, and he must also be able to jump a
little so as to go by short cuts if required to do
so. If for a heavy weight he must be a stout
cob, but for a weight under fifteen stone may
be well bred, or for a light weight actually
thoroughbred.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Hunter</span> may be quite thoroughbred,
nearly thoroughbred, or half-bred. If for a
light weight, say under twelve stone, and in such
flying counties as Leicestershire and Northamptonshire,
a thoroughbred should be ridden,
provided the purse be long enough to procure
one up to the weight and with the necessary
qualities. A nearly thoroughbred will suit a
weight of from twelve to sixteen stone, but
beyond that a horse with great strength, good
action, and a certain amount of breeding—in fact,
a well-bred cart-horse—will be required. If the
country be an open one with large enclosures,
and consequently few fences, the thoroughbred
will be the best horse for hunting purposes,
speed being the requisite, but for a cramped
country, a half-bred horse is the best, being
<a id="png.p085" href="#png.p085"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>better qualified to get over awkward fences
than the thoroughbred, who has for generations
and generations been bred for flat racing, and
consequently has to some extent lost the knack
or power of jumping over a high fence, although
he can easily defeat the half-bred over a wide
jump. Moreover, the hot, fiery, and eager
temper of the thoroughbred is not qualified to
negotiate high, frequent, and difficult fences
with calmness, and therefore accidents are more
liable to happen; whilst the half-bred being of
more equable temperament is not flurried to
such an extent, and when in any difficulty at a
fence is more likely to recover himself and
carry his rider safely to the end of the run than
the thoroughbred. As a rule, the thoroughbred
is not good over rough ground, for although he
may not actually have been trained or raced,
his parents in all probability have, and of course
the training-ground and race-course being
smooth and level, they have had no necessity
or opportunity of picking their way and regulating
their steps to the ground over which they
<a id="png.p086" href="#png.p086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>are going; therefore every breeder of horses
intended for hunting should run his young
stock for a certain period on the roughest
ground he can find, having a few open drains,
bogs, &amp;c., to assist in the education of the
young animals over uneven, broken, and rough
ground.</p>

<p>A hunter should be as near perfection as
regards make and shape as possible, he should
be eager, but at the same time his temper must
be good, his mouth also should be perfect. It
is easy to buy a so-called ‘<em>made hunter</em>’ provided
the purse be of sufficient elasticity to meet the
demands of the vendor. As a rule, and with
<em>very</em> few exceptions, this ‘made hunter’
is a good leaper, has a hard mouth, and
when in view of a fence clenches his bit in
his mouth, and rushes at it at the speed
of twenty miles an hour. I should like to
know what <em>pleasure</em> can be derived by riding
such a brute as above described. It takes
all a man can do to moderate the animal’s
pace, it requires two hands on the reins to turn
<a id="png.p087" href="#png.p087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>him from side to side, and the rider has the
pleasant prospect in the event of a mistake at a
fence, of his horse not being able to recover
himself, the almost inevitable ‘spill’ being the
result. Besides, his mount requiring all his
attention, he is thus unable to enjoy the hunting,
that is to say, he is unable to watch the
working of the hounds, and thus his day’s
hunting (so called) is nothing more than a
modified steeplechase with none of its accompanying
pleasures.</p>

<p>To have a good hunter the best way is to
break him in yourself, provided you are competent
to do so, having a good seat, good hands,
patience, pluck, and above all a liking for the
work.</p>

<p>I will suppose you have a three-year-old,
broken to road work, and that you wish to
break him to hounds. The best way to do so
will be to ride him to the meets as often as
possible, and when he has got accustomed to
the excitement of being amongst a crowd of
horsemen in gay-coloured coats, the foot-people
<a id="png.p088" href="#png.p088"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and the hounds, you may allow him a longer
‘interview’ with them by following them to
the covert. Harriers are the best for this purpose,
owing to ‘puss’ as a rule running in a
circle, where you have the opportunity of
showing your colt everything, without ‘taking
it out of him.’ Besides, the pace being so moderate
you can always get some one to give you
a lead over a small fence or two, in fact you
are teaching your colt to become used to the
crush, excitement, &amp;c., and at the same time
giving him a few easy lessons in leaping.</p>

<p>‘Can he leap?’ is a common question
amongst ‘horsey’ men when alluding to a colt.
My answer to this is that <em>any</em> colt will jump if
in good hands, and provided he has not already
been made a fool of by some greater fool than
himself. Whether it be a thoroughbred, half-bred,
or cart colt, he will <em>naturally</em> jump if he
has not been previously messed about with. I
do not say they will all leap an equal height
or an equal width, but that they will do so to
the best of their abilities. I have frequently
<a id="png.p089" href="#png.p089"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>89<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>leaped colts over fences in cool blood within a
week or fortnight after having first mounted
them, and never met with a refusal. I do not
mean to say that it is good practice to do so so
early, but merely mention the fact. When you
first begin to follow hounds with your colt, do
not stay with them more than an hour, and if
they are running fast leave them before that
time has expired, for your object at present is
not to gallop after hounds, but to accustom
your animal to the bustle and excitement connected
with hunting. With a three-year-old
no galloping should be done, but if the hounds
after the first draw go away, and you think it
probable the fox will return to that covert, or
to one near it, you may ‘potter’ about a little
in the hopes of falling in with them again, but
you must be sure to take your colt home before
he is tired, for the excitement will carry him
through for a time, but on reaching home he
may be quite done up, refuse his food, and be
anything but <span class="smc">A 1</span> for two or three days. All a
three-year-old should do, is to go to the meet
<a id="png.p090" href="#png.p090"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and trot about with the hounds till they find,
and if there is a probable chance of them
circling about for a time, as when in a big
wood, he may still be kept moving. But
when hounds commence to run, the colt should
be turned homewards and ridden quietly so as
to get him settled down if possible before
reaching his stables; he should then be
roughly groomed and left to himself with
a feed of corn for a time, before his final
polish up.</p>

<p>A four-year-old may be allowed to follow
the hounds when running for a short distance,
but at the first check should be ridden home
quietly, and if the run is very fast he should be
eased off, and when the field is out of sight
turned homewards.</p>

<p>A five-year-old may do a little more, but
must not be ridden in a long or fast run,
neither must he be out with the hounds more
than three hours, for he is still a <em>baby</em>, having
only just shed his milk teeth, and donned his
permanent ones. Every hunting man knows
<a id="png.p091" href="#png.p091"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that a horse is not fit to go through a run until
he is six years old.</p>

<p>By the preceding remarks it will be seen
that unless a man can forego the excitement of
the chase he is not capable of breaking-in a
colt with the ultimate view of making him a
hunter.</p>

<p>To teach the colt to leap, the best way is
to take him over small fences every now and
then with hounds; but it will be as well to
give him lessons in cold blood also, and for
that purpose a few artificial fences may be put
up in a field, care being taken to vary them.
Thus, you may have a plain hedge, a hedge
with a ditch on one side of it, and another with
a ditch on both sides; some hurdles, and a
plain but low post and rail fence. These fences
should not be high, three feet six inches to
four feet being quite high enough; the hurdles
and post and rails should be firmly fixed, otherwise
the colt will soon find out that they are
easily knocked down, and then will not even
try to clear them. A fall or two over timber
<a id="png.p092" href="#png.p092"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at the commencement will soon teach the
animal that the fences cannot be thrown down,
but that to elude a ‘spill’ they must be cleared
properly. The colt should be ridden very
quietly at his fences, his head should be tolerably
slack, and every endeavour on the part of
the rider should be brought into play to get
the young animal to fence as quietly as he
would canter over a field; by these means
rushing at fences is overcome, or rather not
taught, and in the event of a slip or fall the
animal has a good chance of recovering himself,
having the free use of his head and the
pace being moderate. One constantly hears of
such and such a rider being very good, owing
to his being able to <em>lift</em> his horse at his fences.
Can a man <em>lift</em> a horse when he is on his back?
Could a man—booted and spurred if you like—seated
across a form or chair with his feet
off the ground, <em>lift</em> it? It is a perfect impossibility
for a man to lift his horse at a fence, and
those people who are in the habit of using this
expression evidently do not think of what they
<a id="png.p093" href="#png.p093"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>are saying. What they really do mean is, that
the rider draws his horse on to his haunches at
his fence and then, with whip or spur, sends
him over. This is all very well—but, for all
that, is bad horsemanship—at an easy, clean
fence; but if the leap should be an awkward
one, with the taking off or landing (or perhaps
both) bad, a horse so ridden would be sure to
fall short of his leap, and, through his head
being too much confined, when he does come
to grief he is unable to help himself. Therefore,
make it a rule to give your horse his head
and allow him to take his leaps as he thinks
best, for depend upon it his instinct will teach
him what is required far better than you can.
I have seen many a fall in the hunting-field
through no fault whatever of the horse, but
owing to the meddling of his rider who imagined
he was able to lift or assist him. When a horse
has over-jumped himself or is in danger of
losing his balance, if you pull at the bit it disconcerts
him, draws his attention away from
his danger, and down he goes as a rule. I
<a id="png.p094" href="#png.p094"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>will here relate a case in point. The hounds
were running when a very high bank stopped
the field, who, one by one, were getting
through a gap in the fence, when a horseman,
being impatient of waiting his turn, backed his
horse a few paces and rode him quietly at the
bank which was over six feet high. The horse
(a four-year-old) landed on the top, but owing
to its height wavered, and seemed inclined to
fall either backwards or forwards. The rider,
with great tact, sat motionless, and allowed the
colt the free use of his head, when he soon recovered
his balance, and jumping down on the
opposite side landed in safety and joined the
hunt. Now, supposing an ordinary rider had
been in this predicament on the top of the
bank, he would have handled the reins and
thus either pulled the animal back on the top
of him or else have fallen on the opposite side;
in either case there would have been broken
bones, if not loss of life. There is one exception
to allowing a colt to take his leaps as he
thinks best, and that is when going over water
<a id="png.p095" href="#png.p095"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or over a fence with a wide ditch on one side
or a ditch on both sides. When a wide-jump
has to be negotiated, the colt must be sent full
speed at it, so as to cover it in his stride, being
the opposite to high jumping; for the higher
the fence the slower should the horse be ridden
at it. I was riding a colt to hounds once, when
a watercourse came in our way; it was not a
wide one, being only about twelve feet across,
but it was six or eight feet deep with bricked
sides and having very little water at the bottom
of it, altogether forming an ugly jump for a
young one who had never been over water
before. I sent him at it at a good pace, but
feeling he wavered on nearing it I swerved him
round and put him at it again, when he again
slackened speed, and knowing that he would
not refuse I allowed him to do as he liked.
He looked down at the bottom of it for a
second or so, and then gathering himself together
leaped over it standing, but fell on the
opposite bank with his hind fetlocks hanging
over the bank; another three or four inches
<a id="png.p096" href="#png.p096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>would have cleared it, but he fell so collectedly
that he did not unseat me although I had to
dismount to allow him to regain his feet. I
always considered this a good lesson, for the
colt afterwards, whenever nearing a water-jump,
increased his speed of his own accord,
having evidently learnt that water could not be
crossed standing. Depend upon it, the less
you try to <em>teach</em> a colt to go across country the
better, for he can do it much better than you
can teach him, provided you only leave him
alone.</p>

<p>In teaching a colt over artificial fences,
great care must be taken not to sicken him of
his work, but every endeavour should be made
to get him to be fond and eager to jump;
therefore, if he is ridden once backwards and
forwards over the fences three times a week it
will be quite sufficient. In the meantime you
may give him a leap or two out of one field
into another, or take him out with the hounds
for a short distance.</p>

<p>A perfect leaper is one who takes his fences
<a id="png.p097" href="#png.p097"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>97<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as a matter of course, just as he would canter
from furrow to furrow over a field; nothing
can be worse than a horse who, on seeing a
fence before him, rushes at it <i>nolens volens</i>; as,
owing to the impetus thus gained, if he makes
a mistake it is very difficult for him to recover
himself. Therefore, take every precaution to
teach your colt to leap quietly and without any
fuss.</p>

<p>When a horse is required to hunt in a
bank country, it is a very common practice to
attach a cavasson to his bridle and lead him
over a few of these fences, but I do not consider
this good practice, or indeed for any kind
of leaping. For if he is taken over small banks
at first he will learn the use of his legs, which
in reality is the object required, and if he
should by chance fall, the pace being so slow
and the height so insignificant, the rider, if he
be competent to break-in a colt at all, will not
hurt himself: for a <em>good</em> rider ought to know
how to <em>fall well</em> as well as how to ride well.
When you fall try to retain the reins in your
<a id="png.p098" href="#png.p098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hand, but if you see that by so doing you run
the danger of the animal rolling over or striking
you, you must let them loose, and if you are
quickly on your legs again you may regain
them before the horse has recovered himself;
but if not, it is far better to have a run to catch
your steed than undergo the chance of being
crushed or maimed by him.</p>

<p>High-couraged generous horses are apt to
go faster and do more work than they should;
therefore they should be kept in check, or their
eagerness to do their work will not keep pace
with their strength and endurance. On the
contrary, sluggish animals require a great deal
of work to make them fit to gallop, and they
also must be roused up from time to time.</p>

<p>Although I feel it is not within the province
of this little volume, I wish to draw the attention
of my readers to the malpractice of washing
horses’ legs and feet, and also of ‘stopping’ the
feet. When washing horses’ legs you are almost
sure not to dry them thoroughly, thereby inducing
cracked heels and the so-called ‘mud fever;’
<a id="png.p099" href="#png.p099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>but if on the return of the animal to his stable
the worst of the mud is brushed off with a stiff
brush, and when dry well brushed again, the
increased circulation so produced will excite a
healthy action of the skin and prevent all
disease. Horses’ feet can very well be cleansed
by means of a pick and a cloth without resorting
to water, which being absorbed by capillary
attraction into the horn-fibres, causes them
to dilate; and thus the horn-substance, instead
of being hard and compact, is rendered soft
and spongy. Again, horses’ feet should not be
‘stopped,’ nor should they be suffered to stand
in their excretions, for the ammonia given off
from the dung and urine dilates to a great
extent the horn-fibres, thus causing the horn to
be so soft that ‘thrush’ is the consequent
disease. I have lately made microscopic experiments
on the healthy horn, the horn soaked
with water, and that with ammonia and water,
and found the fibres in the horny sole soaked
in water to be twice the size of the natural or
healthy horn, whilst that in contact with
<a id="png.p100" href="#png.p100"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ammonia showed the fibres to be three times the
size of those in healthy horn. English racers
in Australia are allowed seven pounds because
their feet are unable to withstand the hard
ground; and, for the same reason, English
horses are useless for racing purposes in India.
Shoes are nailed to horses’ feet for the very
reason that nature did not make them <em>hard</em>
enough to stand work on metal roads, therefore
why do people put stopping into their horses’
feet to make them softer, thus counteracting to
a certain extent the benefit derived from the
shoes? Surely if people <em>desire</em> soft feet there
is rain enough in this country, puddles enough
on the roads, and surface water <i>ad libitum</i> on
the fields, to effect their purpose without resorting
to such a filthy, beastly thing as cowdung.
Horses’ feet get so soaked with water during
their work or exercise, that the aim of every
horse owner should be to <em>keep them as dry as
possible</em> when in the stable, instead of doing
their best to make them rotten and diseased.
Horses in dry climates, such as India and
<a id="png.p101" href="#png.p101"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Australia, have very hard feet because they are
never wet, and for this reason are seldom shod
except when used for work on metal roads;
but when in the rainy season they get soft they
are obliged to be shod, because their feet are
<em>not hard enough</em>.</p>

<p>Paring horses’ feet is also a very bad practice.
Nature meant the sole to be strong, but
when pared it becomes weak, unable to withstand
hard substances, and thus gets bruised
and subject to corns &amp;c. The knife should, in
all cases, be kept off the feet, the rasp being
the best instrument with which to shorten the
walls, and it is also perfectly able to remove all
exfoliated horn from the sole. Is there any
sense in paring an animal’s feet, and then
having to put on leather soles to protect them?</p>

<p>Hunters should not be put to full work
until six years of age, for their bones and
tendons are unable to stand the continued
strain. Until colts have attained their fifth
year, they are shedding their milk teeth and
cutting others; consequently their mouths are
<a id="png.p102" href="#png.p102"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>broken, sore, and the system more or less
fevered. Owing to the soreness and tenderness
of the animal’s mouth, he is unable to feed
well, and thus cannot be got into proper condition;
besides the colt cannot stand the wear
and tear on account of his bones not being
<em>formed</em>, they having more cartilaginous than
osseous material in their formation. The adult
horse, that is, one that has a full mouth, has ⅔
of osseous to ⅓ of cartilaginous material entering
into the composition of his bones, whilst
the two-year-old has about half of each;
therefore the cartilage predominating over the
required quantity of osseous material causes
the bones to be soft and unable to withstand
the shocks of early work. Some owners of
race-horses run their two-year-olds to <em>find out
their weak points</em>. In cases where weak points
are observable at that age, if raced, they are
sure to develop, and thus cripple the colt perhaps
for life, whilst if he had been allowed to
lay by until of a maturer age, in all probability
this weakness would have disappeared. Again,
<a id="png.p103" href="#png.p103"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>if a sound colt be trained and raced when two
years of age, it is ten to one that his tendons
and bones are not able to stand the work, but
that in all probability he will get sore shins,
splints, or perhaps some worse disease of the
legs or feet.</p>

<p>A horse is not able to undergo regular
hunting until he is six years old, and even then
he should not be worked hard. I think all our
own countrymen know this, although they do
not always bring it into practice. The Americans
know it and profit by it. A growing
colt does not make internal fat as does the
adult, therefore the system not having attained
firmness, cannot bear the scraping and sweating
necessary to get him into condition for the
hunting-field or for the racecourse. If the fat
is taken off a colt, his muscular development
is interfered with. In the same way prize-fighters
cannot stay if trained too young, instances
of which are found in Aaron Jones and
M‘Cormick, who, although they felt well and
fit, were unable to last. Colts are forced to
<a id="png.p104" href="#png.p104"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>early maturity and worked hard when they
ought to be in the nursery, the result being
that they are unable to last any time, but
become useless (except for stud purposes)
before they have attained horsehood. Early
maturity means early decay.</p>

<p>The Americans break in their trotters, as a
rule, at three years of age. They then give
them ordinary road work, in the mean time
gradually teaching them to trot in form by
giving them occasionally a spurt for a quarter
of a mile or so. But they do not usually race
them until they are from five to seven years
old; in fact, they do not consider a horse to
be at his best until he is from seven to nine
years of age.</p>

<p>I will now give a few instances of famous
American trotters, who lasted well through not
having been worked too young. Topgallant
was foaled in 1808; when in his sixteenth
year, in 1823, he trotted twelve miles, in
harness, in 38 m. In 1829, when in his
twenty-second year, he trotted four heats of four
<a id="png.p105" href="#png.p105"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>miles, against Whalebone, and won, his fastest
time being 11 m. 4 s. In 1831, when in his
twenty-fourth year, he trotted a race of three-mile
heats, which was won in four heats, Topgallant
winning the second and running second
in the deciding heat. A week afterwards he
won a race for three-mile heats.</p>

<p>Lady Blanche was foaled in 1829. She
first trotted a match in 1835, and when twenty-four
years old she won a race of four heats.
In 1855 she died, during her training.</p>

<p>Dutchman was foaled in 1828, and when
five years of age was drawing bricks in a team.
In 1836, when eight years old, he trotted, to
saddle, four miles in 10 m. 51 s. On August 1,
1839, when eleven years of age, he trotted,
to saddle, three miles in 7 m. 32½ s. In 1838,
when ten years old, he trotted Rattler for
three-mile heats, winning two out of three and
the race. In 1846, when eighteen years old,
Dutchman won another race, but died in the
following year.</p>

<p>Ajax, foaled in 1832, when sixteen years
<a id="png.p106" href="#png.p106"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of age was matched to trot a mare for twelve
miles, and won.</p>

<p>Flora Temple was foaled in 1845, was
broken-in when five years old, and raced the
same year. In 1859 she trotted two-mile
heats against Princess, and won in two heats,
the fastest being in 4 m. 50½ s., when fourteen
years of age. In 1860, when fifteen years old,
she trotted three miles in 7 m. 33¾ s. She ran
in 1861, since which date I have had no opportunity
of finding any record of her running.</p>

<p>Lady Thorn was foaled in 1856; she first
trotted in 1864, when eight years old, and
remained upon the turf until the latter end
of 1870, when she got injured through an
accident. Her best one-mile time was accomplished
in 1869, for four heats, against Goldsmith
Maid, American Girl, &amp;c. She won
three out of the four heats, her fastest time
being 2 m. 18¼ s.</p>

<p>Goldsmith Maid was foaled in 1857, and
ran wild until she was eight years old. In
1865 she ran her first race. On September 2,
<a id="png.p107" href="#png.p107"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>1874, when seventeen years of age, she trotted
the fastest mile on record, namely, in 2 m. 14 s.
Whether her time has since been beaten or not
I am unable to state. She is still on the trotting
turf.</p>

<p>Dexter was foaled in 1858, was not broken-in
until he was four years old, and until then
had never eaten grain of any kind. He did
not trot a race until he was six years old, and
was king of the trotting track until 1868,
since which date I have no record of him. In
1867, when nine years old, he trotted one mile
in 2 m. 17¼ s., and in the same year he won
two heats against Lady Thorn, for two-mile
heats, the fastest of which was done in
4 m. 51 s.</p>

<p>American Girl was foaled in 1862. She
appeared on the track in 1867; and I find she
was still running in 1874, when twelve years
old, and in that year did a mile in 2 m. 16¾ s.,
and in all probability she is still trotting.</p>

<p>Dexter never trotted until he was six years
old; Dutchman never trotted until he was six,
<a id="png.p108" href="#png.p108"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and underwent no training until he was seven
years of age; Goldsmith Maid and Lady Thorn
were eight years old before they were introduced
to the trotting track.</p>

<p>Now having enumerated these <em>facts</em> (taken
from the celebrities of the American trotting
turf), which apply equally to hunting as to
racing, may I ask, is it common sense to gallop
a colt when a yearling, to train and race him
as a two-year-old, and get him screwed and
useless except for breeding purposes when he
is three or four years old, thus doing away with
a long course of excellence and utility? How
many colts ever see a race-course after they
are three or four years old, whilst those that
are able to gallop at five or six years of age
are looked upon as wonders? Look at such
horses as Flying Childers, Eclipse, Matchem,
Goldfinder, Gimcrack, Pot-8-os, Bay Malton,
Glencoe, Bay Middleton, St. Albans, Blair Athol,
Favonius, &amp;c. &amp;c., who never ran as two-year-olds.
Again, look at Macgregor, who won the
2,000 guineas in 1870; and Doncaster, who
<a id="png.p109" href="#png.p109"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>won the Derby and came in second for the
St. Leger in 1873, won the Goodwood Cup in
1874, and the Ascot Cup and Alexandra Plate
in 1875, and was sold for 14,000<i>l.</i>, the highest
price ever paid for a stud horse; both these
horses never ran as two-year-olds.</p>

<p>On the other hand, look at The Rake, Lady
Elizabeth, Queen’s Messenger, Pall Mall, Almoner,
Sir William Wallace, and a host of other
horses, who were not able to stand the shocks
of training. Kingcraft, although he won the
Derby in 1870, came out badly afterwards,
which is generally attributed to his having run
so much as a two-year-old, plainly showing
that however great his speed was, he was
unable to withstand early training, and thus a
good horse was spoilt.</p>

<p>We first begin to train them as yearlings,
and run them so much as two-year-olds that
many become roarers, like Prince Charlie,
Belladrum, and Liddington; or rupture their
suspensory ligaments, like Student, Crucifix,
and Dundee; rupture blood-vessels, like The
<a id="png.p110" href="#png.p110"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Rake, Hermit, and Atlantic; whilst others fall
down dead whilst at exercise, like Orinoco and
Aquilo.</p>

<p>Racing now-a-days is a money-making
business, carried on under the cloak of improving
the breed of our horses, which in
reality is quite a secondary consideration,
money-making being the chief object. I do
not say this out of spite, for I am very much
attached to racing: in fact it is, in my opinion,
the sport <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> of all others. But I
must own I should like to see more attention
paid to the improvement of stock than to the
accumulation of the almighty dollar. So long
as we run two-year-olds, so long will the
stamina of our horses diminish, and our two-year-olds
run a few times and, as a rule,
disappear for ever.</p>

<h2 title=""><a id="png.p113" href="#png.p113"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>113<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER VI.<br
 ><small>BREAKING TO HARNESS.</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Breaking to harness</span> may be divided into two
sections, one for the well-bred horse and the
other for the cart-horse.</p>

<p>The well-bred horse first requires to be
well broken to the saddle and well mouthed,
for most carriage-horses are used for saddle
purposes as well as for driving, many gentlemen
and <em>ladies</em> also riding their carriage-horses,
whilst some hunt them as well; anyhow, the
groom rides them at exercise, so they must be
able to carry as well as draw. The cart-horse,
being of a duller temperament, does not require
so much previous breaking-in before being put
in harness, and a great many which have never
been first broken to the saddle will take no
<a id="png.p114" href="#png.p114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>notice whatever if a man jumps on their backs
and rides them; but it is always best to break
them in a little to riding at first, as a good
mouth is in that way best obtained.</p>

<p>When breaking-in a well-bred horse to harness,
that is to say, one whose pace will be the
trot and not the slow drudgery of the farm or
cart-horse, he must previously have been well
mouthed and broken to the saddle, before a set
of harness is placed on him. Allow him to
smell and look at every article of harness well
before you endeavour to put it on him. Be
very quiet, and take plenty of time. After
having let him inspect the collar, place it gently
over his head. Some men prefer a collar open
at the withers, which can be slipped over the
neck and fastened with a buckle, but these
stretch very much, do not sit firmly, but ‘waddle,’
and thus cause sore shoulders to an animal
which is not accustomed to harness work, and
whose shoulders consequently are not hardened.
For the first day or two it is as well to put on
a collar which is too big for him, and when he
<a id="png.p115" href="#png.p115"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>115<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is actually to be put to, it may be exchanged for
one of the proper dimensions. By this means
a colt will not become alarmed, for the large
collar slipping easily over his head, he becomes
used to the action by the time he is required to
don his own. The pad, crupper, and breeching
must now be placed on his back, the tail elevated,
and the crupper (with a buckle on its
side) slipped under it, care being taken that no
hairs are enclosed by it; then the crupper is
buckled up, the pad adjusted, and the girth
drawn up. It is as well on the first day of harnessing
the colt to omit putting on the hames
and traces, for they would only knock about
and alarm him, but if you decide on putting
them on, the traces must be drawn out horizontally
and firmly attached to the breeching
by means of straps or cording. It is good
practice to connect the collar at the withers
loosely with the pad by means of a strap, to
prevent the collar from slipping forward to the
ears when the animal’s head is lowered. A
common riding bridle should then be placed on
<a id="png.p116" href="#png.p116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the head, and the colt led about for an hour.
By using a common riding bridle the colt is
enabled to see everything on his back, and thus
when any part of the harness strikes him he is
able to see it, and soon getting to understand
the cause, takes no further notice of it. But
when a bridle with blinkers is put on, and at
every step he takes the harness strikes him,
he <em>then</em> does not know the cause, and thus
becoming terrified, it requires some time and
patience to calm him. After he has been led
out for about an hour, a driving bridle with
blinkers may be placed on his head in lieu of
the riding bridle, and then he must be led about
again for twenty minutes or half-an-hour, when
he should be returned to his stables and the
harness removed. You may repeat this for a
short time in the afternoon. On the following
day he must be harnessed again, but with the
addition of the hames and traces, and led about
with a riding bridle, which, after a time may
be exchanged for one with blinkers, the same
being repeated in the afternoon. Of course a
<a id="png.p117" href="#png.p117"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>117<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>very quiet-tempered colt will get used to the
harness in much less time, in fact some take no
notice of it at all; but with a high-spirited or
nervous animal, every precaution should be
taken, and plenty of time spent over the
process.</p>

<p>The colt is now ready for putting to.</p>

<p>Some people advocate breaking-in a colt to
double harness in a break first, whilst others
recommend putting him between the shafts at
once. Undoubtedly when a break can be
secured, it is both safest and best for this
purpose. As to single harness, some people
prefer four wheels to two, their theory being
that in a four-wheeled trap there is no weight
on the animal’s back, whilst in the two-wheel
there is. If this were the only evidence for or
against four wheels <i>versus</i> two, their theory
would be inevitable, but unfortunately for
them, the four wheels have great drawbacks
which counteract the benefit incurred by placing
no weight on the animal’s back, for if the colt
is restive and backs, the hind wheels run out at
<a id="png.p118" href="#png.p118"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>118<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>right angles to the horse and driver, rendering
the vehicle uncontrollable and highly dangerous;
and also when rounding sharp corners, or in
turning, the colt not being as yet handy, the
hind wheels are very likely to be caught against
some obstruction, and thus possibly overturn
the conveyance. Again, during the act of turning,
the hind wheels may become locked against
the fore ones. For breaking to single harness,
the two-wheeler is most certainly the best and
safest, for when rounding a sharp turn, you
know exactly where you are, and have not got
to watch any hind wheels, thus taking your attention
from the colt, which, as a rule, requires
all you can give him; he can also back to his
heart’s content without much danger, or at
least without one fiftieth part of that incurred
with a four-wheeled vehicle.</p>

<p><span class="smc">For breaking to double harness</span>, an old
horse is required which is free from vice, and well
trained to start immediately the word is given,
and to stand perfectly still when required.
The break having been placed with the pole
<a id="png.p119" href="#png.p119"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>119<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pointing in the direction in which you intend
going, the break-horse is put to on the near
side, and the colt (which should have a halter
on as well as his bridle, the shank end being
tied to the tracebearers) led out. The colt is
then loosely buckled to the pole-piece, after
which the trace nearest the pole is passed over
the roller bolt, the animal’s quarters are then
gently forced towards the pole, the outside
trace attached, and the pole-piece adjusted to
the requisite length, then the reins are crossed
and buckled, and the driver, taking their ends,
mounts the box, the old horse receives the word
of command, and the pair start without any effort
on the part of the young animal. If all
this is done quietly, quickly, but without any
fuss, the colt will be put to before he knows
where he is. At starting, and for a little way
along the road, a man (commonly called the
breaksman) should keep beside the colt about
opposite his shoulder, so that at any moment
he can place his hand upon the halter shank,
and be ready to assist the driver, if required;
<a id="png.p120" href="#png.p120"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>but as soon as it is evident that the colt is inclined
to go quietly, the breaksman may mount
the stand behind the box, and stand there, but
must be ready at a second’s notice to jump
down when his services are thought to be
needed. The break should not be out above
an hour, or the colt will be liable to get sore
shoulders, but must be driven about slowly,
and when required to turn round, the breaksman
must help him by pulling the halter towards
himself, whilst the driver turns the old
horse in a wide circle. During the drive the
horses should be stopped and started again
several times, that the colt may get a few lessons.
For the first few days driving either up
or down steep hills must be avoided, but the
work should consist in driving quietly about
roads, teaching the colt to turn round, and also
turn sharp angles into another road &amp;c. A
few days of this kind of work will enable him
to be driven anywhere, such as in crowded
streets &amp;c., but it will not do to take him into
any crush, for as yet he cannot be depended
<a id="png.p121" href="#png.p121"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>upon, and might show fight, which, owing to
the crowd, might not be successfully baffled.
It is a good plan from the commencement of
putting to the colt, on his return to the stable
to bathe his shoulders, whether they appear
tender or not, with a cooling astringent, such
as the lead lotion, for it often happens that,
although you cannot see or feel anything amiss,
they in reality are slightly tender, and on the
following day he objects to the collar. Many
a horse has been made a ‘jibber’ for life
through the want of this precaution. When
the colt has become tolerably handy in the
break, he may be put between the shafts, which
in all its material points will be the same as
that described below.</p>

<p><span class="smc">In breaking a colt to single harness</span>, he
must first have a couple of days’ tuition to get
him used to his harness, as before mentioned
under the head of breaking-in to double harness.
The harness is best when so constructed
that the tugs open from above, allowing the
shafts to drop into them, and every man who is
<a id="png.p122" href="#png.p122"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>122<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in the habit of breaking young horses to single
harness should have a set so made. It is not
difficult to place the shafts quietly through the
ordinary tugs, but when the horse is being
loosed they are very apt to strike the animal
and frighten him; thus in many instances
teaching him, to his dying day, to <em>rush</em> out of
the shafts. The two-wheeled break should be
strong and high on the wheels, that the splinter-bar
may be high, and so prevent the animal
kicking over it, should he be so inclined. The
colt, wearing a halter besides his bridle, is
brought out, the shafts placed gently in the
tugs, and the harness fastened in the ordinary
manner, as well as a kicking-strap over his
quarters buckled to the shafts. The driver
now mounts to his seat with the reins, whilst a
man at the colt’s head pats and coaxes him
forwards, when, on feeling himself confined
between the shafts, he will probably plunge,
rear, or possibly kick. But whatever he does,
he must be reassured and calmed by kindness,
the man at his head giving him such little
<a id="png.p123" href="#png.p123"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>123<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>assistance as he is enabled to, such as pushing
against the shaft or pulling it towards himself,
according to circumstances; he must also run
alongside of him for some time, but when the
animal settles down and gets warmed to his work,
he may either jump into the break or stand on
the step; in either case he must be in readiness
to leap down and help when required. The
colt should not be driven more than an hour, and
when required to turn the man must seize the
halter and draw the colt round towards himself,
at the same time pulling the shaft on that side
towards himself; this must be continued for
some days, until the colt has learnt to push
against the shaft himself. Of course, when the
animal is turned on the opposite side, the assistance
must be on that side also.</p>

<p>If the colt jibs, it is best to sit still and
coax him a little, and when he is tired of
standing he will move on; but there are some
animals which will not do so, and then it must
rest with the judgment of the driver, with his
knowledge of the colt’s temper, whether he use
<a id="png.p124" href="#png.p124"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the whip and risk a kick or two, and perhaps
a rear, or not. A colt being broken to single
harness should not be driven down anything
like a steep hill until he is handy at other
things, for this is the most difficult lesson of all
for him to learn, as he then has the full weight
of the vehicle pushing against him, and it takes
a long time before he will learn to keep himself
straight in the breeching, but will push sideways
and run into the opposite bank, if the man at
his head does not take care and help him.</p>

<p>The bit I prefer to all others when breaking
a colt to single harness is the smooth ring
snaffle, with the reins passed through both
rings on either side, thus converting it into an
ordinary snaffle; but if you buckle them to the
separate ring on either side, the bit becomes
too severe, pinches the jaw, and causes so
much pain that the animal fights with it, and
becoming restive, pays no attention to what
you wish to teach him.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Breaking the cart colt to harness</span> requires
a very different method of operation to that used
<a id="png.p125" href="#png.p125"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for the purpose with the lighter breeds. Some
farmers put them in a team at the plough as soon
as they have been taught to lead; but I do not
consider this happy-go-lucky style at all a good
one. They are not likely to have good mouths,
and the heavy strain of this continual dead
pulling work makes them slow, is inclined to
make them downhearted, and whether they
work in the furrow or on the surface, it causes
them to move unequally with their fellow, and
so is very apt to make them jerky in their style
of going; and moreover, being young, with
their bones and tendons undeveloped, they are
very liable to ‘shoulder slip,’ as it is commonly
called.</p>

<p>The colt should be led about the roads
with the breaking-in tackling on, as stated in
<a href="#png.p019">Chapter II</a>., until he is used to passing objects,
vehicles, &amp;c. He should also be driven in
reins, and then ridden a few times. After he
has got tolerably quiet at this kind of work,
some cart harness may be put on him, and he
is then to be led or driven about for a couple
<a id="png.p126" href="#png.p126"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>126<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of days without blinkers, after which he may
be driven, with the addition of a cart bridle,
with blinkers, when he will be ready for a few
lessons in pulling. Three or four rails or
planks should be tied together, and attached
by chains to the harness, of course having a
stretcher or cross-bar between them. The colt
is then to be led about a field with them, and
after he is found to drag them tolerably quietly
he should be driven instead of being led. You
may keep him at this work for an hour, after
which he must be unharnessed, and his shoulders
bathed with an astringent cooling lotion.
This should be repeated on the following day,
and after that the weight of rails or timber may
be gradually increased; of course this hour’s
work daily is not sufficient, so besides this he
may be driven about the roads in his harness
for an hour or two as well, or ridden. When
he has drawn light loads of timber for a week,
he should be harnessed to an empty cart and
taken on to a road; he may be taken two or
three miles—of course at a walk—and then
<a id="png.p127" href="#png.p127"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>127<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>turned. When on his homeward journey he
may be stopped and started again occasionally,
as well as being turned round every now and
then. A week of this work will make him
tolerably handy, and then he should be taught
to back the empty cart; after having learnt
which he may be made to draw small loads,
and so commence to earn his living. It is a
great mistake to put cart colts to draw heavy
loads at first, for they are much more liable to
jib if not properly broken-in than well-bred
ones; and when once a cart colt has jibbed it
is the most difficult thing in the world to cure
him of that propensity.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned I much prefer
breaking-in colts, whether for heavy or light
draught, without blinkers, for it is much easier
and safer done. Who has not seen a horse
perfectly quiet to ride but having a nervous
temperament, put in harness, half-blinded by
the blinkers, carrying his ears erect but continually
keeping them in motion, turning them
forwards, backwards, and to the side in quick
<a id="png.p128" href="#png.p128"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>128<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>succession, his eyes having a frightened, scared
expression, whilst his whole body indicates fear
of something not understood? Put that same
horse in harness <em>without</em> blinkers, thus allowing
him to see what is going on, and he will be
perfectly quiet and happy.</p>

<p>During the year 1874 light carts were
debited with 572 casualties, including both
killed and wounded, in London alone; whilst
in 1875 the number was 741, being an increase
of 169. The police report that reckless driving
is on the decrease. This great discrepancy in
killed and wounded during the years 1874 and
1875 is chiefly owing to the fact that tradesmen’s
carts are left standing in the streets whilst
the drivers are delivering their masters’ goods.
The horses remain still so long as there is
nothing to disturb their equanimity, but should
a regimental band, a fire-engine, &amp;c., pass by,
away they go on their headlong career until
some passing wheel or lamp-post overthrows
them. Now, if these horses were accustomed
to go without blinkers and allowed to have the
<a id="png.p129" href="#png.p129"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>129<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>free use of their eyes as nature intended them,
they would in nine cases out of ten not run
away. If some object suddenly fell with a
crash near them they would certainly start and
move a few paces (and so would you), but
having the free use of their eyes they would
soon see the cause of their fright, and then
understanding that no harm was intended them
would become still again. Again, if a band or
fire-engine is coming towards them, either from
in front or from behind, they are enabled to see
it, scrutinise it, and become acquainted with its
nature before it nears them; but if the animal
wears blinkers he hears a noise, elevates his
head, moves his ears in all directions (for being
unable to see he makes as much use of his sense
of hearing as possible), becomes fidgety, and
when the object of his fears <em>suddenly</em> comes
within range of his diminished vision, he is
very naturally terrified, and the consequence is
that he runs away to avoid it. I am certain
that if horses were driven without blinkers such
accidents caused by running away would be
<a id="png.p130" href="#png.p130"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>130<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>greatly diminished; it is only <em>fashion</em>, that
bugbear of society, that causes blinkers to be
an inseparable part of harness. I am sure a
horse looks better without them if people would
only accustom themselves to the sight. Why
hide a horse’s eyes, the most expressive feature
in his head? What would a lady be if her
eyes were put out or hidden from view, and
unable to use them as some know only too
well how to do.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter let me remind
my readers that bearing-reins are both useless
and cruel, the former because the horse cannot
pull to the full extent of his power when his
head is stuck up in the air, and that all attempts
to alter the natural conformation of his head
and neck are futile; the latter because the
head and neck being kept in an unnatural and
constrained position causes the animal excessive
pain.</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER VII.<br
 ><small>THE BAROUCHE, LANDAU, AND BROUGHAM
HORSE.</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> barouche is always drawn by a pair of
horses; the landau and brougham are also
pair-horse carriages, except when especially
built for single harness. I shall first suppose
all three of these carriages are intended to be
drawn by pairs of horses. The horses required
for this work are chiefly bred in Yorkshire,
Lincolnshire, and Shropshire, being, as a
rule, a cross between cart-mares—especially if
of the Cleveland breed, now rarely met with—and
the thoroughbred horse. A good horse of
this sort should be lengthy, and yet have a
tolerably short back; should have oblique and
muscular shoulders, long, straight, and strong
<a id="png.p134" href="#png.p134"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>quarters, besides having good knee and hock
action; the head should be neat, and the neck
gracefully curved and well set on. He should
be deep in the girth, have a good round barrel
well ribbed up, and should not be less than
16 hands high. For single harness, in a landau
or brougham, the horse must have all
the above points, but must besides be a heavier
and larger built animal; in height he must not
be less than 16 hands, nor much above that
standard, for a horse which stands 16 hands
3 inches, or 17 hands high, is generally long-legged,
long-backed, and weak in comparison
to his height.</p>

<p><span class="smc">For the Victoria, T-cart, light Waggonette,
Phaeton, or Dog-cart</span>, a better bred horse is
required; he may be nearly or quite thoroughbred,
but must be of good conformation, and
have good and moderately high action; in
height he may be 15 hands 3 inches, or 16 hands.
Norfolk supplies the best horses for this kind of
work, they being strong, handsome animals,
high-actioned, and fast trotters, as far as fast
<a id="png.p135" href="#png.p135"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>135<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>trotting and high action are compatible with
speed.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Omnibus and Van-horse</span> is rather a nondescript
sort of animal, being something between
a carriage-horse and that used for heavy
draught. There is no distinct breed of this
class of horse; but a great many of our omnibus-horses
come from abroad, especially from
Normandy, whilst the van-horses are chiefly
chance gets, picked up here and there wherever
found. Colts got by a carthorse out of a
half-bred mare are very apt to develop into van-horses.
An omnibus-horse should be capable
of drawing a heavy load at a speed of about
8 miles an hour, whilst a van-horse should do
about 6 miles in the same time.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Cart-horse.</span>—The Lincolnshire dray-horse
is a large and magnificent animal, being
the produce of a cross between the old English
black and the Flemish horse, but being very
slow, he has for some time been superseded by
the Suffolk and Clydesdale horses. In his day he
was in great request for brewers’ drays, but
<a id="png.p136" href="#png.p136"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>owing to his want of speed he has now been
almost discarded. The Lincolnshire dray-horse
is now used for the production of carriage-horses
by thoroughbred sires, and also some
breeders of Clydesdale horses in Scotland
are rather fond of crossing them with the
Clydesdale, and selling the produce as thoroughbred
Clydesdales, thus realising a thoroughbred
price for a crossbred animal.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Suffolk Cart-horse</span> is chestnut, varying
from a sorrel to a moderately dark chestnut
colour; he is rather long in the back, deep-chested,
full in the flank, and deep-bellied,
having clean and wiry legs and a full crest.
He is often seen in the South of England, but
the Clydesdale is fast superseding him. Taking
into consideration his make and shape, I do not
see why the mares should not produce good
carriage-horses, if mated with suitable thoroughbred
sires.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The Clydesdale</span> certainly is at present the
king of the cart-horses in Great Britain; he is
generally of a bay, brown, or black colour, the
<a id="png.p137" href="#png.p137"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bay and brown predominating. He has a neat
well-bred head, a good neck, deep girth and
round middlepiece, is short in the leg, the bone
of which is remarkably large, and the fetlock
covered with long hair. Much fashion depends
upon the growth of hair at the fetlock; formerly
it was curly, but now a Clydesdale will
not pass muster unless he has about six inches
of quite straight hair on these parts. Great
prices are given for these horses, even when
yearlings; when thoroughbred or <em>supposed</em> to
be so, some good sires being let for the season
at 500<i>l.</i> In Scotland they are all the rage,
great care being taken with their breeding,
although occasionally a breeder does sell a
crossbred one as a thoroughbred, thus putting
a nice little sum into his pocket.</p>
